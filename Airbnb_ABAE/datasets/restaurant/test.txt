"We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.",
"They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.",
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.,
"After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.",
"I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.",
The duck###confit is always amazing and the foie###gras terrine with figs was out of this world.,
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.,
"For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.",
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.,
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.,
Chow###fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family.,
I had the duck###breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.,
"The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.",
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.,
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).,
"The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock###shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!",
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!,
Food-awesome.,
Service- friendly and attentive.,
Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.,

Food-awesome.,
Service- friendly and attentive.,
Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.,
"however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",
"i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.",
"i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.",
Food is great.,
Service is top notch.,
"I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea###urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.",
"It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.",
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.,
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.,
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.,
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.,
The Prix###Fixe###menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).,
"It is terrific, as is the value.",
"$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.",
"I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.",
"The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.",
"The kitchen however, is almost always slow.",
"Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.",
"The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.",
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.,
The lava###cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.,
"Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.",
"This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.",
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!,
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.,
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.,
I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow.,
The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious.,
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.,
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.,
"My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.",
Decent wine at reasonable prices.,
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.,
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.,
The food was bland oily.,
"We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.",
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.,
"When we sat, we got great and fast service.",
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.,
But the pizza is way to expensive.,
"A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.",
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.,
Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.,
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.,
"Service was prompt, friendly and great.",
"There was a small wait, but shorter than I expected.",
Located at the end of a magnificent block.,
Very cozy and warm inside.....,
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.,
Get the tuna of gari.,
"Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .",
"With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .",
It's all about the food !!,
"but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.",
"those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.",
"they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.",
Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.,
"Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for.",
"Try everything for that matter, it is all good.",
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.,
"The Steak###Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.",
"Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.",
"Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!",
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.,
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. .,
it's delicious!,
"Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude.",
"Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.",
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.,
Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.,
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.,
Try their chef's specials-- they are to die for.,
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction,
"Raga's is a romantic, cozy restaurant.",
The exotic food is beautifully###presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.,
It is also extremely well priced.,
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.,
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.,
"The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...",
"Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes.",
Such a disappointment...,
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.,
Our server was very helpful and friendly.,
The food was good too.,
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent.,
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.,
Service was prompt and courteous.,
But too far east!,
"The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.",
"Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella###sticks on the menu.",
"Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.",
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.,
fine dining restaurant quality.,
Over 100 different choices to create your own.,
The staff is no nonsense.,
The food options rule.,
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.,
"He served me an Uni Hand roll, which I never had before, and let me tell you...IT WAS HEAVEN!",
The sake menu should not be overlooked!,
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.,
"Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive.",
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.,
"Seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening.",
"The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.",
"The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb###Salad.",
It's simply the best meal in NYC.,
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.,
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile.,
The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.,
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.,
The bagel was huge.,
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.,
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).,
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.,
"Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa###fe chopped salad and fish and chips.",
All the staff is absolutely professional!!,
But they do.,
"(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...)",
"There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).",
My chow###fun and chow see was really bland and oily.,
Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.,
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.,
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic.,
The price is reasonable although the service is poor.,
fresh restaurant was amazing........ food was delicious and of course fresh.,
"great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...",
Hats off to the chef.,
"the salads are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy.",
We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.,
too large for just two people but nothing was left.,
"Great vibe, lots of people.",
"I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.",
"Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.",
Salads were fantastic.,
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great.,
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me.,
"This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.",
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.,
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.,
"I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.",
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.,
"And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).",
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.,
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar###Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty.,
"We concluded with tiramisu chocolate###cake, both were delicious.",
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.,
"You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff.",
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.,
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.,
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two.,
MMmmm... it was delicious.,
It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.,
The food is authentic Italian - delicious!,
"Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta.",
I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.,
The hanger###steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.,
The filet###mignon dish was superb!,
It's a small cute restaurant.,
"I like the ambience, it's very dark and original.",
The sushi is amazing!!!,
And amazingly cheap.,
Very affordable and excellent ambient!,
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.,
We were very disappointed.,
We won't go to this place again for a good meal.,
"However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.",
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.,
"First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.",
"Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.",
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.,
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.,
"For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc....",
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.,
"To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.",
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.,
Fish was overdone.,
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.,
One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.,
Their tuna###tartar appetizer is to die for.,
"I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.",
It is simply amazing.,
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.,
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!,
"The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.",
The staff offers impeccable service.,
I had Lobster###Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine###Lobster in it.,
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster###Bisque.,
It was divine melts in your mouth.,
My boyfriend had Prime###Rib it was good .,
We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough.,
It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!!,
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.,
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.,
It's very spicy but not offensive.,
The wine list is excellent.,
"With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.",
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.,
"We ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat.",
This place is so much fun.,
Our food was great too!,
And really large portions.,
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.,
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.,
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.,
The place is a lot of fun.,
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience.,
"The food however, is what one might expect.",
It is very overpriced and not very tasty.,
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.,
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.,
Drinks way over priced.,
Great pizza for lunch place.,
Service was quick.,
The pizza was great.,
And it was quick which is very important.,
Have the iced###tea.,
It was wonderful.,
Delivery is fast too.,
Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.,
"The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size.",
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.,
The lox is always fresh too.,
Not impressed with the food.,
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.,
Zero ambiance to boot.,
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu.,
"The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.",
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.,
Taxan delicious!,
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me.,
Try green###curry with vegetables.,
"The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.",
I had the best ravioli ever.,
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list.,
"The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.",
"Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic###vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.",
"If you go, try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce, the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm..... everything is just delicious.",
Check out the secret back room.,
The food was authentic.,
I felt as though I were eating in Paris.,
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.,
Very good wine choices.,
Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC!,
Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad.,
Great staff.,
Always great service!,
"The food is good, I can't lie.",
But the staff was so horrible to us.,
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.,
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.,
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.,
"Most importantly, food is excellent.",
Try the sea###bass.,
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks.,
I am happy i did the food was awsome.,
JUST AWSOME.,
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.,
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.,
"Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried.",
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives.,
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality.,
"limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice.",
"the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish.",
the waitstaffs are nice though.,
"Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.",
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.,
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.,
"The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.",
"I had their eggs###benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.",
The service was attentive.,
"The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!",
"Try the Pad###Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!",
"Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!",
"They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.",
"Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.",
"Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.",
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices.,
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever.,
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.,
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.,
The food is tasty and portion###sizes are appropriate.,
Food is excellent.,
Fish is so very fresh.,
Waitstaff are very friendly.,
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.,
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.,
"When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.",
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.,
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods.,
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.,
"I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir###fry blue###crab.",
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.,
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.,
"The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.",
"(The asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!)",
Wine list is extensive without being over-priced.,
"Be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, specials.",
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.,
"The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.",
"I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!",
"The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.",
"The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.",
"After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on.",
"We did tip, I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager.",
"The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.",
Pizza here is consistently good.,
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal.,
You should pass on the calamari.,
It is thick and slightly soggy.,
Decor is charming.,
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!,
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.,
"A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.",
"When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently",
"While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.",
The wine list is also really nice.,
The food is great and reasonably priced.,
"I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.",
"If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.",
"Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed.",
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.,
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.,
"I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had.",
"I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world.",
"We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.",
The food was good.,
The place was nice and calm.,
but the service was a bit slow.,
The buffet had a nice selection.,
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.,
Service was also very good.,
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.,
"But, they were too big for the bun.",
"Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.",
Also they were $15 each!,
It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!,
"The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.",
And the Tom###Kha soup was pathetic.,
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.,
"We went here for lunch a couple of weeks###ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.",
"The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.",
"Conveniently###located too, being right on Bedford ave.",
"THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.",
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.,
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.,
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right.,
love the food.,
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic###japanese comfort food.,
"The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice###cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).",
I've waited over one hour for food.,
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.,
An excellent service,
We were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial.,
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.,
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.,
"Always a nice crowd, but never loud.",
"By far, the best pizza in Manhattan.",
The menu has so many fish items and oysters.,
"The fish was really,really fresh.",
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!,
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.,
It's to die for!,
"Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.",
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!,
"While their kitchen food is delicious, their Sushi is out of this world.",
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else.,
I ordered the smoked###salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor.,
"The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.",
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu.,
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well!,
Authentic Taiwanese food that's cheap... what more could you ask for?,
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.,
"Kind, attentive wait staff.",
I really like both the scallops and the mahi###mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).,
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos.,
Delicious crab###cakes too.,
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice.,
"Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK.",
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.,
The counter service is bad.,
They charge different prices all the time.,
"They're rude at times, and not very friendly.",
"Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.",
"The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.",
"The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.",
"Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot).",
"This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.",
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.,
"It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.",
"This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.",
Great sushi experience.,
Unique apppetizers.,
Try sushimi cucumber roll.,
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.,
Murray won't do it.,
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.,
But who says Murray's is anything about service.,
The service is awful.,
"Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.",
I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing... their Pizza.,
They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.,
A little crowded but they move that line really fast!,
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!,
the turkey burgers are scary!,
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.,
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.,
The sushi was awful!,
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.,
"Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.",
"The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.",
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese###cuisine.,
"Good, fast service.",
Food is great and inexpensive.,
The location is perfect.,
"Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.",
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.,
Always busy but fast moving.,
Great atmoshere and worth every bit.,
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.,
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.,
"For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.",
"Try the Pad###Thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious.",
"The service was attentive, yet discreet.",
The flavors robust and subtle.,
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.,
The place was quiet and delightful.,
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad (they are all good),
"The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).",
"The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.",
"But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.",
"The in-house lady DJ on Saturday###nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.",
"Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.",
I LOVE their Thai,
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!,
In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!,
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.,
I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.,
The food now is inconsistent.,
The setting is casual and romantic.,
The food is excellent!,
"if you're daring, try the balsamic###vinegar over icecream, it's wonderful!",
"Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.",
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.,
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.,
"A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork###buns and egg custards.",
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:,
The food was exceptional.,
"I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb###shank in red wine, which was excellent.",
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.,
The fried dumplings are GREAT!,
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.,
"They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!",
"Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.",
"Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.",
"delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven.",
Service is fast and friendly.,
"Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.",
But that is highly forgivable.,
"But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.",
You must try the shrimp appetizers.,
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.,
"If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.",
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.,
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.,
"Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.",
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.,
Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!,
The food was absolutely amazing!!,
The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we've ever had!!,
"The lamb was tender so full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!",
The waiter was attentive.,
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.,
Dessert is a joke...dont bother,
"Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.",
"The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.",
"Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...",
Cute and decorative.,
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.,
(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!,
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience!),
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.,
And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!,
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.,
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.,
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.,
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.,
Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.,
"The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.",
A real dissapointment.,
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.,
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.,
"Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater.",
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ###ribs in the city.,
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).,
Quick and friendly service.,
"When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.",
"I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.",
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.,
They all know you.,
Good food.,
Good drink.,
I have never had cheescake like this.,
I thought I had died and gone to heaven.,
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor###seating in the warmer months.,
"We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.",
"i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.",
"stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes.",
"service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.",
skip dessert.,
Best Reuben sandwich ever!,
A classic!,
"The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.",
It just wasn't Thai.,
Was surprisingly disappointed.,
Pizza was a little soggy.,
Not enough wines by the glass either.,
"Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.",
Authentic Pakistani food.,
People are always friendly.,
"Just straight up cheap, good food.",
The best pad###thai i've ever had.,
The design and atmosphere is just as good.,
bottles of wine are cheap and good.,
The food was actually aweful.,
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.,
"The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.",
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.,
"The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.",
go here for the drinks!,
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm.,
"Ask for Usha, the nicest bartender in manhattan.",
My fav was the sassy lassi...,
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.,
I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg)###rolls.,
"Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.",
Amazing!,
"Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.",
The food's as good as ever.,
"In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.",
"The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.",
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!,
Beef###noodle###soup is good as well.,
Best Taiwanese food in NY!,
"We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor###seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me.",
Indoor was very cozy and cute.,
"The portion###sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.",
Staff is very accomodating.,
"I got the $10 10-piece dim###sum combo, every bite of which was great.",
But $1 for each small piece???,
Not worth it.,
The decor is very simple but comfortable.,
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate###bread###pudding for dessert.,
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.,
The owner truly caters to all your needs.,
"When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.",
Everyone was more then happy with his choices.,
Great food and the prices are very reasonable.,
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).,
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast###pork.,
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.,
"Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.",
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...,
Service is not what you are coming here for...,
"whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT.",
even the wine by the glass was good.,
Consistently good Japanese Tapas.,
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too...,
Yakitori (bbq meats) is tasty too.,
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.,
Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.,
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.,
We were then shooed inside.,
"One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.",
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.,
He offers subpar service and has no personality.,
"In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.",
There is no excuse for such lousy service!,
You can do it here.,
$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten.,
"Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.",
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.,
The food is great.,
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.,
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.,
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.,
The pizza was pretty good and huge.,
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.,
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.,
"The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol",
"La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.",
I recieved prompt service with a smile.,
"To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.",
The wine list is extensive and impressive.,
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris.,
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert...definitely going to be back very soon.,
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.,
"Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.",
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here.,
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.,
"Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea###Bass and Crispy###Duck.",
Great food.,
"The pastas are incredible, the risottos (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing.",
Overpriced and not tasty,
The food here was mediocre at best.,
It was totally overpriced- fish and chips was about $15....,
Tasty Dog!,
"An awesome organic dog, and a conscious eco friendly establishment.",
One of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten.,
But the best pork souvlaki I ever had is the main thing.,
Super YUMMY Pizza!,
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant.,
"I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza, as well as their pastas!",
"We had half/half pizza, mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza!",
"The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting, without it trying to be that.",
"I paid just about $60 for a good meal, though :)",
Great sake!,
"Reliable, Fresh Sushi",
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious.,
Have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once.,
Delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week.,
Delivery guy sometimes get upset if you don't tip more than 10%.,
Best. Sushi. Ever.,
This place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi.,
"Creative, consistent, fresh.",
"Excellent sashimi, and the millennium roll is beyond delicious.",
not only is the food,
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner,
There is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week.,
Good food: my favorite is the seafood spaghetti.,
Excellent food for great prices,
The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating.,
"The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food.",
i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good,
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked.,
I wasn't here for the pizza so I can't comment on that yet but what I had was very good.,
The service was quick and friendly.,
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome.,
I thought the restaurant was nice and clean.,
I ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed.,
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.,
The potato balls were not dry at all... in fact it was buttery.,
the food is always fresh ...,
Chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top??,
food was luke###warm.,
The waitress was not attentive at all.,
I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have.,
I do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $400.00 where I am not swept off my feet.,
"Red Dragon###Roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down",
Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon###Roll.,
"If you don't like it, I don't know what to tell you.",
The Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly.,
I'm not even going to bother to describe it; it speaks for itself.,
Favorite Sushi in NYC,
"In the summer months, the back garden area is really nice.",
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food.,
"The Dancing, White River and Millenium rolls are musts.",
Gross food – Wow-,
I can't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York.,
My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor.,
And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?,
"Don't get me started on the margaritas, either.",
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila.,
Great Indian Food!,
When I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly.,
The staff is very good.,
Love their drink menu.,
I highly recommend this beautiful place.,
They honored reservation on Sunday###afternoon very well.,
We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $8 a piece.,
Nice view of river and NYC.,
Great survice,
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious,
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night.,
"Oh, and there's hookah.",
Raymond the bartender rocks!,
The omlette for brunch is great...,
"the spinach is fresh, definately not frozen...",
"quacamole at pacifico is yummy, as are the wings with chimmichuri.",
A weakness is the chicken in the salads.,
"It's just average, just shredded, no seasoning on it.",
"Also, I personally wasn't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole.",
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.,
"What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro###meat and sausages), and made of much higher###quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.",
"All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.",
The veal was incredible last night.,
"Fresh, mind blowing flavors.",
"Delicious, creative and fun.",
It is so romantic.,
"Its dark, and cozy.. there is always jazz music playing when we go.",
Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.,
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together.,
Service was wonderful;,
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful.,
"Paul, the maitre d', was totally professional and always on top of things.",
"The bar drinks were Eh, ok to say the least.",
The stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard.,
"We thought the dessert would be better, Wrong!",
"oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting.",
"The floor was wet, the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor, no soap, and no hand towels left.",
"The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ""free"" appetizer of olives was disappointing.",
"However, our main###course was wonderful.",
I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations.,
When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost.,
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location.,
"short and sweet – seating is great:it's romantic,cozy and private.",
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.,
"Servers are all different, Greg is my favorite.",
"Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner.",
This is the first place I've been that a runner remembers my order... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant.,
"I go out to eat and like my courses, servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink.",
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings!!!,
this place had ALL the trimmings and i mean all.,
"peppers, onions, relish, chilli, cheeses, you NAME it.",
amazing fun for hot###dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!!,
The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for!,
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd.,
Maggot in the food!,
"Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.",
"When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.",
"The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.",
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.,
"I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.",
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.",
Unhygienic,
I got hair in my food 2 times of then !,
"The food is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced.",
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.,
Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance.,
Good creative rolls!,
"They have great rolls, the triple color and norwegetan rolls, are awesome and filling.",
"One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!",
"They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert, as well as a great green tea tempura.",
The appetizers are also delicious!,
Amazing food.,
Mazing interior.,
Great food!,
I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers.,
"The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.",
"If you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing.",
"Indo Chinese food, pretty good...",
"My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.",
I was speechless by the horrible food.,
"I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing.",
"for 7 years they have put out the most tasty, most delicious food and kept it that way...",
so delicious!!!!!!,
Hands down the best pizza on the planet.,
"In about 12 minutes, the thing is gone.",
great hot dogs..,
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.,
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late###night###munchies or a mid day boost!,
great taste,
"Great, original taste.",
"For me dishes a little oily, but overall dining experience good.",
The only thing that strikes you is the decor?(not very pleasant).,
great food,
This place has great indian chinese food.,
The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal.,
"Best Indian Chinese in the city, by far!",
The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced.,
"THE SERVICE IS AMAZING, i've had different waiters and they were all nice, which is a rare thing in NYC.",
"The DJ is awesome, I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back.",
You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they don't make you by bottles.,
Which lets face it....at times it's a good thing.,
Everything on the menu is great.,
But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine?,
"Look, the appetizers were really good.",
The entree was also very good.,
"Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.",
"Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.",
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu###beef.,
Bison was quite excellent however.,
Dessert: pure disaster.,
Just not good at all.,
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.,
"If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.",
"You would think they would make up for it with service, sadly, no.",
"Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.",
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.,
The place is beautiful!,
The hostess was very pleasant.,
"However, our $14 drinks were were horrible!",
"Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!",
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.,
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.,
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.,
We asked for beverages and never received them.,
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.,
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.,
I would not expect this for a $55 dinner.,
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!,
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!,
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!,
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.,
"By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!",
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!,
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!,
"At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.",
"There was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment.",
"Not much of a selection of bottled###beer either, we went with Brahma.",
"The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.",
"I believe there were 2 shrimp in the ""salt encrusted shrimp"" appetizer.",
"She replied ""well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded.""",
I had the Thai style Fried Sea###Bass...which was very good.,
I heard the lobster roll was excellent.,
"They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand).",
"Service not the friendliest to our ""large party""!",
Great Indian food,
"Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.",
"Very ""normal Indian food"", but done really well.",
"Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.",
I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).,
"But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food",
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.,
"However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.",
None was made so i hung up.,
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.,
Eat at your own risk.,
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner,
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!,
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.,
"The bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling.",
Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.,
The nakgi-bokum was horrible.,
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted.,
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.,
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.,
She just nodded and walked off.,
"As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.",
My wife had barely###touched that mess of a dish.,
We were charged full price.,
The wife had the risotto which was amazing.,
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.,
i love margherita###pizza – i looove east village pizza,
"The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.",
"Personally I like the margherita###pizza better, but they are all good.",
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City,
"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!",
"If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).",
"My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!",
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse###bouche.,
"I picked the Grilled Black###Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled###Salmon dish was better.",
The sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.,
"For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.",
"I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.",
"The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.",
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!,
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.,
Great Shabu###Shabu,
"But for the Shabu###Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.",
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork###belly tacos.,
"The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.",
The food tasted very good.,
The family seafood entree was very good.,
The main entree was also very good.,
"This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...",
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.,
"The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.",
Good Food,
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .,
The atmosphere was great.,
"Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.",
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.,
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel###guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.,
Polite acknowledgement is out;,
supercilious scorn is in.,
"And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?",
"At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.",
"We arrived and were seated###immediately, which made us both happy.",
Everything was going good until we got our meals.,
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.,
"It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed###potatoes.",
"I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.",
"At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.",
"So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.",
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed###potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.,
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.,
"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing.",
"After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!",
"No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!",
"This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.",
"Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!",
The level of rudeness was preposterous.,
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED.,
cirspy crust margherita###pizza,
it was really good pizza.,
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):),
It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.,
Great Hot Dogs!,
"Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.",
"The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!",
"Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!",
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.,
"But nonetheless--great spot, great food.",
"As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!",
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.,
"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??",
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!,
"There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.",
"I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal.",
"Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.",
"Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service.",
"So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...",
"Maitre-D-""Eat and get out""",
"While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.",
"This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.",
"His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.",
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else.",
"If you go here, do it on his off-night.",
Best meal in a long time!,
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.,
I had the Lamb special which was perfect.,
"My father had the flank###steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.",
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level,
"At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot###dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot###dog.",
Here the hot###dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.,
Great Atmosphere,
"I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.",
Poor service and management,
Appetizers took nearly an hour.,
When the main###course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.,
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.,
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.,
"When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.",
"On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.",
Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.,
"On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.",
"Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.",
"The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.",
So rude!!!,
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.,
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.,
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.,
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party.""",
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.,
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.,
bad staff,
The food is good.,
The design of the space is good.,
But the service is HORRID!,
"I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.",
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.,
"I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!",
"The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet###peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).",
"I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.",
"She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.",
"I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.",
