der erste eindruck von außen ist recht unscheinbar parken kann man gegenüber auf dem parkplatz eines zoofachhandels hoch gehts dann entweder per treppe oder aufzug die einrichtung ist absolut typisch wie bei den meisten asia restaurant die bedienung war bei meinem ersten besuch einigermaßen freundlich geht besser aber auch deutlich schlechter wir kamen zum buffet welches au verschiedenen bereichen besteht einmal hat man da klassische asia buffet mit einer vorsuppe real fisch fleisch verschiedenen saucen frühlingsrollen gebackenen wantan spießen gemüsen gebratenen nudeln gebratenem real thai curry einmal quer durch asien alles man kennt und mag eine kleine auswahl sushi steht auch zur verfügung im anderen teil gibt e rohe fisch rotbarsch krabben tintenfisch lachs und fleischsorten welche man mit verschiedenen gemüsen und saucen auf einem grill frisch zubereiten lassen kann de weiteren gibt e ein kleines salatbuffet und die üblichen dessert wie gebackene banane eis aber auch kuchen tortenstücke und ein paar andere sachen alles allem keine überraschungen aber alles gut heiß und schmackhaft da alles für 14 80euro da kann man nicht meckern die toiletten sind sauber und gut begehbar ob man allerdings mit einem rollstuhl bi die toilettenkabine kommt da bin ich nicht sicher sich würde ich e aber al behindertengerecht und barrierefrei bezeichnen al dicker mensch hat man hier auch genug platz e wird auch gern ein tisch etwas verrückt um den platz zu schaffen draußen sitzen kann man auch hier wäre ich aber etwas vorsichtiger und würde um einen stuhl von drinnen bitten da die bestuhlung au den allseits beliebten aber unstabilen monoblöcken besteht da lokal hat keinen ruhetag kartenzahlung ist problemlos möglich wir kommen gerne wieder

je suis allée au atomic café pour une soirée musicale et ai de point positifs et négatifs mentionner je vais commencer par le négatif le son de la salle est mauvais pour le show de musique trash je pense qu il aurait que de la musique douce dans le style acoustique qui sonnerait bien dans la salle en ce qui concerne le consommations ai aimé originalité de breuvages non alcoolisés malgré leur simplicité dans le boissons alcoolisées ai goûte leur cidre et ai été agréablement surprise moi qui aime pa le cidres surettes le leur était sucré était délicieux autre point positif la décoration attiré mon attention ça aurait été cool si il avait de la lumière colorées pour le soirées pour donner une touche encore plus rétro tape oeil bref si occasion se présente retournerai ça semble être un endroit sympathique

literally got back home visiting casa la femme offended visit felt necessary try warn diner value money time
visit say least unpleasant costly experience
even unpleasant costly unpleasant experience
although told minute like 45 minute
ushered bar wait momentarily upon arrival excited
place beautiful
hostess pleasant
however 14 drink horrible
finally got table despite indicating wanted alla carte menu pushed table price fixed
experience ever get better
course waited hour 45 minute never offered drink
also asked hooka six time waiter kept telling u one minute never returning hooka
time asked waiter said dinner
asked beverage never received
asked side waiter admitted forgot put part order
chicken inedible many fatty lump keep spitting napkin
would expect 55 dinner
time finished dinner still received one beverage hooka
