My partner and I stayed for a week at Terrys during our vacation and it was a great experience.  We were happy with our decision to stay there.  The space is comfortable we were able to relax.  The room is very close to the train, so it was easy to hop on the train and get around Boston and come back to our room whenever we wanted.  We felt welcomed, safe, and comfortable.  I would recommend it without hesitations.

Terry is welcoming and helpful.  The condo was lovely  thoroughly applianced kitchen, gorgeous bathroom,  comfortable lounge and cosy bed. I felt very at home and it was easy to get in to Boston, with loads of useful information, mpas, books etc.  The only small niggle is that the staircase to the bedroom was a surprise but otherwise thank you for a wonderful warm stay

Terrys place was a great space for a single or couple traveling for a short term in Boston. The bed was comfortable. Room had adequate space, included a closet with hangers, mini fridge, sink, microwave, TV and good lighting. The water in shower was plenty hot for a long shower. Lots of plugs and places to charge. Check in and access to apartment was very easy. My only caution for future renters is that this unit is on third floor 2 flights of stairs. I would caution renting if you have mobility issues or a lot of large luggage. I also did not feel very comfortable walking very far in this neighborhood. However the Uber system and drivers in the area are fantastic

We had a wonderful time at Terrys. We never actually met him  which I like  No offence TerrybrAny questions we had which really was about leaving luggage was answered promptly. Easy access to apartment too. We really liked the quirkiness about it and it was spotlessly clean. 5 min walk to the nearest subway. Terry left a book with lots of recommended eating places and we actually ate at most of them . Very comfy bed and the pillows were just perfect brI noted that a couple of people had said it wasnt in the safest area A lot of rubbish.brWhen we arrived a very nice couple with their dog came across the road and asked if they could help  we were looking at a map at the time  We ate at the wee restaurant at the brbottom of the hill and they couldnt have been nicer.

I stayed here for a week over Christmas and it couldnt have been a nicer place to stay, Terry stayed away thought i wouldnt have minded him saying helloso it made the place feel like my own home with me being able to come and go at my leasure and he even left out some things to make my stay even more enjoyable. Location is great once you know how to use the quick train service into Boston. Only down side was it seemed that the heating was on only when it was turned on up stairs and the radiator was very noisy, other than that, a great place to stay.

The apartment was clean, comfortable, and wellfurnished.  It was always nice to come home to during our fivenight stay.  Terry was polite and always available by phone to answer questions.

I was a bit nervous about staying here due to reviews about safety. Rest assured, this area is super safe. Do not take a cab here. Cab drivers only know downtown. Take the T, its cheaper and easier. Terry greeted us and broke down the area for us. We love the layout of the apartment.  Our only hiccup was the shower as the temperature was all over the place but thats wasnt a big deal to us as we live in NYC and in our apts the same thing can happen.  Plan to eat at The Squealing Pig in Mission Hill it has a great vibe and food. For most of the trip, plan to eat the Back Bay Area as there are some great places around the house but not as many options as we New Yorkers are use to. We had the run of the second apartment and very much enjoyed our stay. If you have any questions, Terry is a text away. We would return to The Fort Hill Inn in any future visits to the area.

My friends and I had such a wonderful experience on our trip.  Terry was extremely quick to respond whenever I had a question. He was also very flexible with allowing us a slightly later checkout time due to our later departure from Boston Logan.  His home is a short 5 min walk from the trainbus station, and we never had issues obtaining an UberLyft from that location. His home was very clean, very well decorated, there were basic supplies in the kitchen if you needed to cook or open a bottle of wine, we had plenty of fresh towels, complimentary bathroom toiletries and extra pillows. He also provided a nice map and guide to Boston which was appreciated. I highly recommend this location if youre in town for vacation or work, and the convenience to the train station was very helpful

A lovely apartment in a nice area of town. It is located outside of the city core, but only a short subway ride away. I felt very safe there, and it was about a 5 minute walk away from the Roxbury Crossing station. The apartment was a good size, and the kitchen had all the amenities that we could have wanted. Nicely decorated and quiet, except for some construction noise around the community college occasionally. We used both the downstairs bedroom and the pullout couch. Both were comfortable. We appreciated the maps and tourism info. There was lots of street parking in the area. Would definitely stay there again. Thank you Terry.

This place was great. It was warm and bright. Its only a few blocks from the orange line and the train can get you pretty much anywhere in Boston. The beds were comfy and the decor was welcoming.

I stayed in the apartment for three weeks and had a very good experience. The location is superb, next to the state house and a short distance from Boston Common and Park subway station. The apartment was clean, and excellently equipped with basics, sheets, towels, and even foodstuffs and cleaning supplies. While the apartment is very well maintained, some of the infrastructure is nevertheless not very new e.g., the AC is old and very noisy, and some furniture were shaky or of low quality. Anne was remarkably professional and considerate, and communicated quickly to solve problems. For example, when things needed fixing e.g., a light was broken, or there was a leakage from the apartment upstairs Anne acted immediately to fix them or, when Anne wanted to show the apartment to another agent, but learned that I was somewhat uncomfortable with it, she promptly cancelled the plan. One last thing to note is that the apartment has big windows with lots of natural light that is not blocked by the semitransparent curtains.

Check in and check out was very easy.  We stayed in The Penthouse, and it was very enjoyable.  There is a balcony that gives a really night view of the city of Boston, and the apartment is very clean and comfortable for a family.  My son from England joined me here, as well as my daughter from California.  We all enjoyed it.  The neighborhood is being renovated, and public transportation, either bus or subway, are both near. We would stay here again, if in Boston.  The only drawback is that you have to walk up four flights to get to The Penthouse, which was no problem for my son or daughter but for a 67 year old with arthritis of the knees proved to be a task.

Train station is also very close and transportation was not a problem at all.  My only complain is the access to AC  Heat.  Is locked in a box and no way to control the climate inside the apartment.

The apartment is located in a charming building.  The neighborhood has lots of character and was always safe during our stay.  There is a great restaurant next door which was convenient for us.

The subway was near by as well, which we found handy when we did not want to drive downtown.brbrAccessing the apartment was easy, yet the apartment felt safe with a locked entrance.  The apartment itself had plenty of space for four adults and one toddler.  It was very clean.  Im extremely picky about mattresses due arthritis.  My mattress was great.  I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable it was.  brbrI would say the only hiccup we had was that the air conditioner would blow warm air at times and cool air at other times after we arrived.  We were unable to reach anyone until the day after we arrived due to us arriving later in the evening the night before.  They sent someone out that day to fix the problem.  We did have a fan as well.  The rest of the week the weather was fairly cool and we didnt really need to turn on the AC.brbrI would defiantly recommend staying in the apartment to both friends and family who were interested in visiting Boston.

Clean location in Boston with comfortable beds. I was annoyed to have to communicate off the AirBnB app and with the two emails asking when I was getting there, how I was traveling, was I bringing a car, would I need later check out, etc. The air conditioning didnt work the first night meaning open windows on a very noisy street.

The bed was not very comfortable, but fine for a few nights. The room was clean. I shared a bathroom with one other person, but there was never any hot water. There were other people stayingliving in the house but I never ran into them. There are no locks on the bedroom or bathroom doors I didnt realize this until I arrived and was only given a key to the front door of the house.

If you are traveling to Boston by yourself and are looking for a great value with a perfect location, consider this Airbnb. Robert is a kind host, and he provided knowledge of shuttles to the convention I was attending, as well as ideas for what to do in the evening. brbrThe location was excellent. It is very close to Copley Square and all of the entertainment and food for which one could hope, and if you are in town for a convention at the big convention center on Summer St, it is only a 2 mile walk. I loved it for starting and ending my day, as it took me through Chinatown, and I also explored other parts of the city.brbrAs Robert states, the bathroom is shared, but in my 4 nights there, it was never a problem.  He provides instruction on how to use the shower and to be patient for the hot water, as it must climb 4 stories to get to the shower. brbrMy two recommendations for guests arebr1. When looking for his house number, you will not see it where other houses display, as he uses a side entrance beneath the main stairwell. It can be a little tight.br2. Pack lightly or in smaller bags. You will have several flights of stairs to climb to your room, and as is typical for the era of the home, the stairs are steep and narrow. Also, the halls are narrow, so large luggage may prove challenging. I used a backpack, and I was fine, though with my bigger body, it was tight in a couple spots. brbrIn closing, I would recommend this Airbnb to light travelers who are looking for outstanding value and location and who are able to climb stairs. Free wifi is available. There is no television, but with Boston just outside your door, TV isnt needed. brbrThank you, Robert, for your hospitality.

Staying at Roberts place was a great experience overall. The street is nice and quiet and located so close to all the major attractions in Boston.

Robert was a wonderful host to communicate with, both during the booking process and throughout my stay. It never took more than an hour for him to return my emails and he was very accommodating with my changing schedule. The neighborhood was within walking distance of the Boston Commons, the Boston Public Library, as well as tons of shops and restaurants. Anyone who has trouble with stairs should note that the room is on the top floor of the building and the stairs are a little bit steep. That said, the room was very quiet, spacious and clean with a sitting area, deskworkspace, and air conditioning. However, the room does not have a lock on the door which took some getting used to. I would definitely recommend this room to someone traveling on business or attending a conference.

But the room and bathroom was spacious, clean and nice. The host dioes kindly help with the carrying the luggage up and down the 4 floors upon arriving and departure which was very kind. The room is centrally heated hence no control over the room temperature. It can get a little hot or cold at times, but wasnt too bad at all.

Fantastic location Roberts house is very well located for just about anything in Boston, in a very charming neighborhood on a quiet street near Copley square. The house is very charming and old worldly with lots of books and antique furniture. The  room is on the top floor, so a bit of a climb The bedroom is conveniently next to the shared bathroom. The water wasnt particularly hot though, and since it was a little cold in the room and the bathroom, it wasnt the best shower experience. It was snowing outside though. The mattress could do with replacement, it is really noisy Robert was a wonderful host and very flexible with arrival and departure, he was very friendly and shared lots of tips on where to go and what to see, which was very helpful I would not hesitate to stay here again if you want to be in the center of it all in Boston

The location is excellent   in a beautiful old rowhouse on a quiet street in the South End, and yet perfectly situated for exploring Boston. Its 2 blocks from the Back Bay orange line T station, and 4 blocks from the Copley Square green line station. Also, 3 blocks from a BlueBike docking station, which I used as my main form of transportation during my stay. Robert was a considerate host, and after our initial meeting when I arrived, stayed out of my way which I appreciated.  The bed was much too hard, though, and had no give  it was painful to sleep on. I ended up sleeping on the couch instead  not what I thought I was paying for.  Also, thin curtains on the bay windows and especially a skylight the room is on the top floor let in bright sunlight at sunrise, which woke me up and prevented me from falling asleep. If you are an early riser, or a very sound sleeper, this may not matter to you, otherwise you may want to factor that into your choice. Had I known there was no way of reducing early morning sunshine, I am sure I would have picked another location.

First of all, I should explain that my experience was not literally my experience I live in Boston myself but did the booking for my parents that dont speak any English. Roberts place looks great, its a beautiful house, really clean, greatly decorated, perfect environment for people wanting comfort and cleanness in a relaxed environment. My parents really liked the room and Robert not only was understanding of their poor English skills, but embraced our brazilianism trying out his own Portuguese skills, hes a great guy About the neighborhood, I live in Jamaica Plain myself and love it, its got tons of cool places to eat, parks and ponds around and an awesome and relaxed environment with easy access to downtown Boston, perfect for students or turists that dont want to pay ridiculous amounts of money to stay downtown and stay in a place that, in my opinion, is more fun and less busy. brRobert  uma tima pessoa, e para todos os brasileiros a afora pensando em visitar Boston, ele tem uma conexo com o Brasil e se divertiu usando seus portugus.

Roberts house was a very comfortable and convenient place for my 7 week stay while I was in between moving from Boston to Chicago. The room is very generous in size with plenty of room for clothing and personal belongings, including a largesized dresser and a large closet. The room is located at the back of the house, was very quiet at night and made for easy sleeping. The desk space was also very convenient. The adjacent bathroom, as well as the rest of the house, is impeccably clean. The common areas are also very comfortable and wellmaintained, and his dog Rocco, is a very sweet and wellbehaved dog. It is a perfect location in Jamaica Plain, and very convenient for those commuting to the Longwood Medical Area. Robert was a gracious host and I highly recommend staying at his place for your visit to Jamaica Plain and the Boston area.

Just returned from a week in Boston, staying at Atefs studio. The studio was exactly as described, entry is via the courtyard garden at the back of the house access via a private alleyway at the side of the house.  The studio was clean and comfortable and certainly large enough for one person.    There is a cooker which I didnt use, refrigerator and microwave which I did use as well as a range of kitchen implements.  Lots of storage space and a comfy sofa to sit on.  Access to the laundry facilities was very useful and its just outside the door so handy too.  WiFi availability was a great bonus.  The studio is at basement level, and 2 of the windows glass blocks rather than traditional windows are at pavement sidewalk level on the street.   Despite this, it was very quiet, there was very little traffic or other noise from outdoors.brbrThe location of the studio is very central, and is within walking distance of downtown Boston and other sights  less than 10 minutes to the nearest T stop, approx 10 minutes walk  to North Station for trains to Salem  Gloucester.  Charlestown itself is lovely, it was very safe and comfortable to walk round important for a single traveller like myself.   Bunker Hill monument is at the top of the street  a great landmark so you wont get lostbrbrI met Atef and Lulu the cat when I arrived, and both of them made me feel very welcome. I had no problems with the doors which another reviewer commented on.   The courtyard garden looked very nice, I didnt use it myself, although guests are free to use it if they wish.brThis was my first AirBnB experience, and I was delighted with the result.brNow where to next

Hermina is a very pleasant and accommodating host. When my wife and I first booked with her we thought she was on Park St. in the Beacon Hill area of Boston and then realized she was in Dorchester Center. Initially we were a little concerned with the proximity to downtown Boston and safety but after spending four comfortable nights in the attic room with the portable AC we were quite pleased with the convenient location and our stay. Its a 5 minute walk to the Fields Corner Red line train station which takes about 10  12 minutes to the heart of the main tourist areas and connecting train lines. The T Train system is very efficient and easy to use. We felt quite safe in the area and the local police station is on the adjacent lot at the rear of her home. We really enjoyed our time in Boston. Thanks Hermina.

I and my friends were very happy with our accommodations and Herminas place. We stayed in the attic room C. The house has several other nicer bedrooms that may be available  lots of options for different size groups. brRoom C, as advertised, was minimalist but it was a big open space and had plenty of room for the three of us to sleep and spread out our stuff slanted ceilings so not a lot of head room for the large amount of floor room. The staircase to the room is very steep and the bathroom is one floor below so dont stay in this room if you would have a problem with those things. There are also only a few outlets in the room so dont plan to plug in a lot of electronics.brThe kitchen, dining room and living room are very nice and the bathrooms are clean and functional. brThe neighborhood was okay with a few bars and restaurants, a grocery store, liquor store and other shopping. We picked up groceries and made breakfast each day. The kitchen is well appointed and well organized. The only problem with the neighborhood is that there are usually people hanging out in the area of the shopping center. If you find this type of environment uncomfortable you may not be entirely happy with the neighborhood but we did not have any trouble with anyone other than minor annoyance from a panhandler. Note that the house is next to the police station so it is in a very safe place.brThe subway station is just a few blocks walk from the house  less than a 5 minute walk. Public transport is the way to go in Boston  you can get a 7 day pass for 19 that gives you unlimited use that even includes the inner harbor ferry. I found this subway stop just as convenient for my needs as when I have stayed near the Back Bay stop  yes I had to plan additional time but it was just as easy to get to all the places I visited.brIf you will be driving to Boston for your visit you will be happy to hear parking is simple near Herminas place. Street cleaning rules only make you move your car once every two weeks so it should be easy to arrive, park and not worry about your car until you need it.brbrI will most definitely stay at Herminas place for future trips to Boston. Most likely I will stay in one of the other rooms but I was very happy with my stay in Room C for this visit.

My friend and I stayed in the attic room which was exactly as described. I wish I had paid better attention to the previous reviews about the bathroom because there were many people sharing one, which is not something that I like to do. Nevertheless, it worked out well enough. The attic room is spacious, no frills and inexpensive. The steps are steep but didnt pose a problem for us. brbrHermina was entertaining friends from Armenia when we visited. Her attention was focused on them, understandably. We did not have much of an opportunity to speak with her because we didnt feel as though we should interrupt their visit. Hermina was friendly and we enjoyed the limited interaction that we had with her, but the situation didnt allow for what I have come to consider a typical Airbnb experience. We felt intrusive whenever we came into the kitchendining room area while her friends were around. It would probably have been better to make the attic room unavailable during their stay. brbrWe did find a wonderful new coffee shop that was located a couple of blocks away. It is called Home.stead Bakery and Cafe. I recommend it highly. The neighborhood is gentrifying and mixed. As two women, we felt safe enough while walking around the area. brbrIn general, it was a very affordable, clean and reasonably comfortable space. I did not see a fire escape from the attic room which was a bit concerning. And we were not offered a key to lock our room but to be fair, we never asked for one. It was fine, our things were safe and so were we. If you are looking for an inexpensive stay in the area and not particular about any of the details Ive mentioned, it is a fine place to stay.

Really nice, big room.. had sleeping arrangements 3 people 4 if someone shared a bed, very clean. Hermina herself was very nice. Lots of good food within walking distance and a pretty secure location right next to a police station. Close to a train station which made getting around Boston really easy, would definitely look for her again next time im in boston.

I absolutely loved my stay at Herminas place. The room that my family and I stayed in was huge  it was the entire floor space of the houses attic. There were two larger beds, one smaller bed, and a futon. For being so hot outside, I expected the room to be uncomfortably warm, but it was surprising cool and had a box fan as well. brThe location of the house itself was very convenient right around the corner from the Red Line train stop and across the street from many stores.

Our stay in Michelles place was really nice. Michelle is just a wonderful host, when we arrived to Boston, she was waiting for us at the metro station. And then, on our way to her house, she gave us a nice explanation about the neighborhood, restaurants, pubs, etc. brAs it was our first visit to Boston, we didnt have a clear plan for visiting the city, but Michelle advised us where to go. She even cooked some extraordinary blueberry muffins for breakfast brAlso, she gave us a ride to the bus station the day we left, that was so helpful for us.brThe room is really good, with a big and comfortable bed. The rest of the house is beautiful too. In short, our experience in Boston was great.brThanks a lot Michelle

This being my first time using Airbnb, Michelle certainly set the pace for all other hosts in the future. I stayed a week at her place since I was looking to rent an apartment in the area. Michelle offered lots of advice about the area, she even took me on a little walking tour around the neighborhood The home had everything you would need, and I especially appreciated the yogurt and granola every morning. Thank you so much for your hospitality

Initially we were a bit uneasy about the location. However, after being walked around the area with Michelles friend who met us and let us in as Michelle had to work we felt a lot more comfortable. brThe room was clean and a good size. The breakfast was nice and there was a huge selection of tea available. Also the bathroom was clean and a good size. The entire apartment is shared by 3 rooms  Michelles and 2 Airbnb rooms but we didnt find that an issue, the bathroom was always free and it was also very quiet.

Michelle was a great host, when we arrived she welcomed us at the subway station, provided us with some maps and info on the area. The house is beautiful with lots of light, and after a long day of walking it was great to crawl under  the super warm covers. Every morning we enjoyed her delicious muffins, a great start to the day. The house is a 10 min walk from the subway, but if youd like to see as much as Boston as you can, you can even walk to downtown about 45 minutes. All in all everything was perfect, and if we come back to Boston well definetly stay there again.

Hi future travelers,brSo I was here for 5 days. I would list good and bad points so that it will be helpful for everyone.brBad points brroom  The room I was in, was not comfortable, everything was way too old. The furniture, cupboards, bedsheet, bed, closet and work table and chair was not comfortable.brBathroom  Bathroom cannot be locked from inside. Though it was clean and nobody disturbed me when I was there. It is a new place and it is uncomfortable to use bathroom that cannot be locked from inside.brRules and regulations  this is my first Airbnb experience, I felt there was many rules and regulation. brcheck in and check out time  this was the most problematic for me, I had talked about it with the host previously about my early check in and late check out request, she said she wouldnt be able to do early check in but would try but house was not available till 4PM. Then she said I could checkout anytime till a day before I leave but on that day she wanted me to leave inbetween 10 Am to 11 am. I hate last minute changes. My flight was at 4PM and I spent all the time at airport. It is difficult to carry luggage and see around Boston.brLocation  so the nearest bus station was Dudley square. It was the station I used mostly as Hidden by Airbnb showed it was easiest way to go to my destined location. I didnt find it that safe. The safety line is pretty thin and you have to walk 9 min to the station. I was there one day at 8Pm , there was too much noise and even uber driver told me she wouldnt use that station at night time. The house is safe and you will feel safe with the host too but if you want to take bus and go to the station, it wont feel that safe.brGood point was brDinner with the host and friends  The only thing I enjoyed when I stayed was the lobster dinner host invited for. I could meet new people and here there stories, it was fun meeting other guests in the house.

A bustling historic location during the day, emptying out to a charming neighborhood at night. Access to the commons, downtown and the river is great and there are tons of restaurants and a Whole Foods near by. The doorman building is gorgeous and the rooftop deck cant be beat, especially on Fourth of July Laundry on every floor is a great feature too. Two thumbs way up

Location was fabulous and the kitchen well equipped.

Slightly disappointing  I booked Annes place not only for the location, which is perfect, but also based on previous reviews stating how clean it was. Unfortunately we didnt find this to be the case.brbrThe Checkin process is really quick and simple, perfect after a long flight from the UK. Anne came to the apartment shortly after our arrival to bring some paper work and was lovely and very pleasant to deal with, even having some tips on things to visit and places to eat that tourists wouldnt normally know about.brbrHowever, prior to her arrival we had to use some cleaning wipes we had brought with us to give the apartment a clean, as everything was dusty and dirty. The bathroom also needed cleaning, particularly the toilet which was stained. The apartment could actually do with some much needed TLC and repairs, as it felt run down. There were various cracks on ceilings and walls plus the paint on the bathroom door was peeling, we also bought our own pan to cook with as the ones provided were greasy or stained.brbrAdmittedly we didnt raise this with Anne as we have seen reviews of places on Airbnb where guest have had their bookings cancelled after raising such issues so didnt want to risk that happening and its just easier to give the place a clean ourselves. brbrThe apartment is in the city center so understandably there is some noise from outside. But such a location makes it absolutely perfect for visiting local attractions and shops. We enjoyed regularly strolling around the common as it was just a very short walk away. Its also worth noting the apartment is really only suitable for 2 people for stays of around 5 nights, as the size and condition of pans makes it difficult to cook and eating out every night can prove costly on a long stay.brbrWe found a whole foods near by but ended up doing our shopping at Roche Bros instead, which is a little more convenient and it was also cheaper. There are also some great pubs within walking distance that are reasonably priced and have nice food Emmetts  The Red Hat in particular.brbrThe building itself is extremely secure, so much so we decided to leave the apartment for a few days to visit cape cod and marthas vineyard. If the weather allows, a visit to the roof deck is advised as the views are stunning.

Right down the street from Boston Common, Annes place is in the heart of it all. 15 minutes to the harbor and her neighborhood is full of history.

Anne was the perfect host, from offering to bring a fan on one of the hottest days of the year to extending our checkout when an unexpected visit to the ER occurred and providing us with wonderful restaurant recommendations. Thanks for making our stay so comfortable

This unit was in the most wonderful location and Annes communication was totally on point. Emmets Pub was a GREAT food spot Im picky about pubs and the food was really super there.

The security staff did an excellent job and became a part of the social atmosphere of the building.brbrI was there for 9 weeks total and each time I stepped into the door I was happy to be home.

I just got back from my trip and I feel totally rested. I had a wonderful time in Boston and Christiane was a great host. I felt welcomed in her home and the private room was more than I expected. If you are looking for the  cookie cutter experience you might want to go somewhere else. Christianes home has a cozy charm and I felt totally comfortable there. The Charlestown neighborhood is amazing , full of history and charm. Dining at the historic Warren Tavern is a must do. There is easy access to downtown Boston and Christiane gave me passes to a couple of the Boston museums. I felt sad when I had to leave on Friday, however I will be returning to Boston and I hope to stay at Christianes place again.

Lovely home, in a great, safe neighborhood.  Lots of historical sites within walking distance.  Home and room very beautifully decorated, and very comfortable.

Christiane is a gracious, accommodating hostess. She served breakfast every morning and, while the kitchen was not available to us, she provided snacks and would prepare coffee or tea if we saw her in the afternoon or evening.  Christiane provided abundant tourism information, maps, bus schedules, etc and even museum passes. brbrThe location is wonderful within view of the Bunker Hill monument, around the corner from the bus stop and about 0.5 mi from the T station. Its a quiet, residential neighborhood of charming row homes.  brbrThe spiral staircase to the waterfall bedroom is very narrow and rather steep and probably would not accommodate anything larger than a carryon suitcase. The house was built in 1885 and has lovely stainedglass windows. There is very limited floor, counter and shelf space available since there are many pieces of furniture, collectibles and household items. The TVDVD players in the living room and bedroom and extensive DVD collection are available to guests. Christiane made us feel very welcomed and we thoroughly enjoyed our Boston visit.

Comfortable bed, no AC, far from the T the subway confusing directions. Host was not very personable and would not let me talk more than two words before she interrupted.

Christiane was a lovely and welcoming host. She was quite sweet to have gotten my nephew a present and give a parting gift. If youre staying in Charlestown, this location is great. brbrOne item to note is that though the photos are bright, the place itself is not.

Hermina is a gracious host and her house in Dorchester is very comfortable to stay in as well as being convenient to the Red Line of the Boston MBTA. I was put in one of the two basement rooms, which disappointed me at first, since the pictures all seemed to show light and airy rooms on the second floor, but the actual room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The room had a bathroomshower just outside, which is shared with the other downstairs guest. There is also a handy washing machine 1.00 and drier 1.50 in the shared hallway. The only disadvantages to the downstairs room is that there is not a lot of sunlight coming through the tiny window, and the room is a bit damper than the upstairs part of the house. Breakfasts were hit and miss, as there are often many other guests and eggs and bacon and juice can disappear quickly. However, there was always something to eat and I certainly didnt starve. The wifi worked well, so I was able to do my email and check out the weather and other Boston activities. All in all, Id say it was good value for 55night in an outer neighborhood in Boston.

Hermina was a lovely host.  She was very communicative over eMail and phone and I felt secure knowing Id have a place to stay.brbrShe has several units, in the same building.

It had a little kitchenette, loads of space, and very easy access in and out.  It felt like having a full apartment to myself. Available street parking was a big plus for me.

Dont risk your time and money.  Here is my unbiased reviewbrbrThis was a misleading experience with bad room condition, worse condition than 20 hostels Ive stayed at abroad.  The room location changed twice, and upon arrival at the second confirmed room location, the key we found under the mat as instructed did not fit in the door.  Upon calling Hermina the host, she said that the person might still be occupying the room that was reserved for us she wasnt sure, and said she had another room for us.  It was not a room, it was a dusty, lowceiling attic with poor lighting and an air mattress.  The sheets smelled of urine odor.  There were old sneakers propping up a small window.  This neglected space had random stored items scattered in it, clearly not a place to put paying guests.brbrWe were confused and disappointed, but didnt complain, being it was late and we were tired and none of the rooms we were promised were available.  We reluctantly slept on the uncomfortable air mattress in the attic, and booked out of there asap in the morning.  I wish there had been an alternative.  For 70, this is nowhere close to the condition I would have expected.  Though its conflicting that there have been good reviews for this host and location, its possible no one else has had to sleep in the creepy attic.  So, just letting you know  dont let that happen to you.brbrI have used AirBnB before, and my past experience was by far much better than this one.  I really enjoy giving great reviews, and am disheartened to have to report this as a bad one.

Did not get to meet host as she was out of town, but she did provide us with people to contact in Boston if needed. Instructions to house were good and got into house OK. We were not told which room we would be staying in  as there are several that she lets out  and had to contact hosts friend. When we found our room the door was locked and there was someone asleep in our bed We arrived after 1pm which Hermina told us was the check in time to be told by the woman in our bed that Hermina had said she could have the room until 5pm as she had just worked a night shift The lady kindly let us leave our massive backpacks in the room but we had to take all valuables with us. We were not informed of this by the host. brbrWhen we came back later that evening, the room had been vacated. The room was nice and spacious and the bed was comfortable, although there was a random mattress leaned up against one of the walls. brbrWe were then woken up at 1.30am by two of the other guests washing and drying their clothes in the machine. As the bathroom  which is where the machines are located  was right next to our room, the noise was extremely loud and we had a lousy nights sleep. I spoke to the girls who apologised, but then kept going brbrEven though the house is next to a police station we did not feel 100 comfortable coming back to the house in the dark because of the neighbourhood and so came home early. brbrHermina clearly uses her house as some sort of hostel. We were not expecting this. The sheets and towels were thin and there were dirty sheets on the landing and in the front room. Would not stay here again.

We made a last minute reservation and were initially skeptical about the neighborhood after hearing from friends, but we had no other option so booked it anyway and I am glad we did. We arrived late at night and found someone else in our room, but hermina was quick to sort it out. The room is very clean, spacious and comfortable with a shared bathroom next door. I appreciate the fact that Hermina provides everything not the case for many Airbnbs washing machine, dryer, bath products, breakfast, fresh towels, heater etc. It is a fantastic deal also because it is only a few minutes away from the station. There are a few eateries nearby too. Just a note you can hear street sounds at night so maybe not the best if you are a light sleeper. Didnt bother us at all. Also the stairs to the room are a bit steep so consider that if you need to. Otherwise this was the perfect place and I would definitely stay again.

This was to allow me to bring my bike into the house.  This space was clean and neat, though not Victorian.   My bedroom was welcoming and the bed comfortable.  I had a good nights sleep.  The bathroom, shared was clean and convenient.  There was a very lively couple there who shared that floor with me.  All good.

Hermina is a very nice lady that welcomed us in her house. The house is very nearby the trainstop Fields Corner. Fields Corner is according to Hermina a safe neighbourhood but we had our doubts, didnt feel very safe after sunset.  brThe room was very big and next to the bathroom  which Hermina kept very clean. brIn the morning Hermina offered some apples from her garden so I could make a fresh applejuice. Besides that we could eat from her bread, cream cheese and jams. brWe felt very welcome

Room B in Herminas place is very large and fits three guests easily. Although it was quite warm, the room was comfortable with the ceiling fan and windows on various sides. The house is well located for public transport, parking is easy. You will meet other guests but there is enough privacy. Good place for exploring Boston.

Hermina was a very accommodating, kind host. However there is no AC in the room and during our stay we made the mistake of leaving the windows open. It was extremely noisy, but after closing the windows the noise was less of an issue. I also did not feel safe walking home from the T at night.
host negative
Hermina was sweet. The location was not the best, but it was a very close walk to the Red Line so that was great. Our main problem with staying there was not at all her, it was mainly the fact that she overbooks. The room was clean and beds were very comfortable. There is no AC so beware, during the summer it is quite hot upstairs where all the bedrooms are. Our problem was that there in only 1 12 bathrooms in the entire house and there were several groups of airbnb people staying there, not including herself and her two young kids. It was almost impossible  to take a shower and get ready in the mornings and evenings, because as soon as one person gets out, another gets in. Her washerdryer are also located in the main bathroom, so people are in there doing laundry while others need to showeruse the restroom. brbrHer house is also right next to a Boston police station, so we could hear dispatch and cars often opening and closing. If you need quiet to fall asleep, this is not the place you want to stay. brbrOverall it was an alright experience, but I would not stay there again. It would be a much more comfortable experience if Hermina stops overbooking her place.

It is a good experience. Hermina is very kind. The room is very clean and neat. Kingsize bed is very comfortable. The only one thing  to bring me a little trouble is that I could not do my laundry because it was 900 pm after my bath. Hermina told me there will be  big noise of washing machine. She told me I could wash clothes in another machine next morning. However, I have to check out early next day. So, I suggest you should do some laundry on the day time if you need wash your clothes.

We stayed in Terrys 2bedroom apartment from May 1619, 2014. There was plenty of room in the two full bedrooms for 2 couples to stay in comfort. The apartment is decorated very tastefully and we especially appreciated the fine quality towels in the bathroom, a detail not always found in airbnb properties.  The kitchen was nicely stocked with cutlery, pots and pans, spices and a great coffee maker that kept coffee hot for what seemed like hours. brbrWe found the location to be very quiet at night and slept so soundly. Shopping is nearby and handy with Terrys guidebook and his own personal recommendations for restaurants. He was there to greet us and show us around the place. Tremont street is very near to the suite and it has all you need.  There are a few homeless on the nearby streets looking for handouts but we never felt threatened or unsure of our safety. brbrAll in all a great value in an easy location with access to the T Bostons underground just 5 min walk away. Thanks for making our first stay in Boston so memorable Terry, we hope to be back soon.  Robbert, Dawn, Henry and Jo

If you want to have a nice stay in Boston and you dont want to be in the Down Town area this is the place to be Its a very cosy and comfortable apartment with a real Im coming home atmosphere. Spacious living room with well equipped kitchen some more glases and plates are welcome. Beds are comfortable and the neighborhood is quit. The apartment is located at a 5 minutes walk from the subway T station with good connection to Boston down town and other areas. It is on the top of Fort Hill, so some climbing when walking home from the Tstation is required. There was still over 4 feet snow on the side walks but still sufficient parking space in Centre street. We really enjoyed our week at Fort Hill

We had such a great time on our 1st trip to Boston. Terrys apt. was the perfect place to call home when we werent out and about. The apt was furnished impeccably and incredibly comfortable. The T line was so close and easy to use and we saw and did so much in 5 days. He met us when we checked in and answered all our questions. We saw him periodically and hes super nice and even mailed some items I left behind. Theres a great balcony with a grill on it that we used as the weather was perfect.

It is true that Hermina is a nice lady and offers helpful informaton. But the Beautiful Townhouse or Beautiful Victorian House is an exaggeration.  This is an old old house in a rundown old part of Dorchester, south Boston.  The interior was spartan but adequate. The sheets were old and threadworn and just lying on the Kingsize bed, which took up all of the room. The front lawn was ragged. The house badly needs painting, which Hermina is trying to do but the contractor is not performing. It is right next door to a Boston Police Substation, so you can feel safe.  We shared the two bedroom one bath apt with a nice young couple from France.. Sorry to be negative, but when my wife saw the neighborhood as we got near to the place, she didnt even want to go inside. I talked with Hermina and encouraged her to keep up the maintenance on the exterior of the house

This is what Im looking for with airbnb lowbudget travel and meeting good people in the confort of your home. This what Kathe offer me, with a smile. Its not too far from downtown Boston if you dont mind taking the bus. Dont forget, its not a hotel. Its a little friendly place for you to sleep and gather more energy for the day.

Kathe was such a lovely person, so hospitable and always willing to help me out with anything I needed i.e. directions and a phone number in case I got lost while exploring Boston. Accommodation was great, and very easy to get around using public transport not far from all the action of Boston. I always felt safe in the area, and only a short walk to a small grocery store and pharmacy for essentials. I would recommend staying with Kathe to anyone

I highly enjoyed my first Airbnb experience at Fannys place. The bedroom shown with the slanted roof is especially great because its one of two on the top floor of the house, allowing for a lot of privacy. Additionally, it comes with a rather private living room and kitchen, making the place feel like a full home. Fanny was also exceptionally welcoming,  helping me to carry my suitcases and dropping me off at the nearest station when I was ready to leave. The surrounding neighborhood is filled with a lot of local convenience shops that sell various thingsclothes, shoes, food, and a  local CVS. All in all, I felt that I could not have had a luckier first experience with Airbnb.

We rented Kristina and Chriss place for a long weekend and it was perfect  It was our first time in Boston and we loved the neighbourhood, and the apartment.  Kristina provided us with very clear and simple directions to get from the airport to their place on the subway. Very quick and convenient  Jamaica Plains, which is a short subway ride from downtown,  is great neighbourhood with some very good restaurants and nice places for a drink. The Whole Foods Store was also short walk away which was perfect for filling the fridge. After a couple of days running around town in was nice to be able to just  cook  dinner and kick back in your own cozy apartment.  The kitchen was well equipped with everything you need to cook a good meal.   Wed definitely stay with them again

Chriss place is a really great alternative to Boston hotels, which are always , or if you just want to stay somewhere homier.  Especially for a longer stay.  Truly is very large studio in excellent condition.  A great value for the price. Pleasant and responsive hosts though you are not actually sharing a livings pace with them.

We didnt get to meet in person, but kept in touch through airbnb en and sms.brbrI would definately stay here again. Recommended

Absolutely beautiful neighborhood and apartment, when we come back to Boston we will definitely stay here again if its available. brbrThe apartment is actually a studio on the back of the hosts house with a separate entrance. About 8 minute walk from the subway which takes you into the heart of Boston within 10 minutes. The neighborhood is close to a lake and several nice cafes, my wife and I would get breakfast then take a walk before heading into the city to see the sights. We both felt at home in the studio and enjoyed that it was outside of the city a little bit, felt like the countryside a bit but still gave us convenient access to the city.

This studio is very well appointed with all a single person or couple could want. The subway is a short walk away and it is a bit different to stay in the suburbs rather than the city as its quiet and peaceful. Kristina was very responsive and happy to answer any queries.

She left us a map with lots of recommendations which we followed and enjoyed.

Chris and Kristinas studio was just perfect  We stayed for a week and the studio was completely comfortable for an extended stay.

If youre familiar with the area, its ideal...and if youre not, its still ideal because its safe, quiet, close to the subway, win walking distance to all JP has to offer including the pond.

Nice little place.  Very conveniently located with a short walk to the T, and only a few more blocks to the Sam Adams brewery free tours  and free beer.  Kristina was there to greet us.  She couldnt have been more gracious, allowing us an early checkin and ready to answer all our questions, then checked on us during our stay to make sure we were comfortable, bringing us whatever was needed, even a new pullout bed  My only con is that the bathroom is far from private, with just a folding closet door between you and the bed, and a very small shower.  But its very clean with lots of amenities  microwave, small fridge, full kitchen with plates, cutlery, pots, etc, even coffee and tea in the cupboard loved that, iron and ironing board, hangers, and blow drier.

Kristina was very accommodating and she let us leave our bags in the apartment before check in time so we can wander around the city.  The neighborhood is quiet and it made us feel like we were Boston residents rather than tourists. Its an upstairs unit and Im glad we packed light because it would have been difficult to carry a heavy luggage up to the apartment.  The place is clean and has cable TV which enabled us to watch the Warriors game. We were there during the hottest day of the year and needed AC but had issues that was later resolved which we are grateful for.  The place is comfortable and spacious and we liked the sofa bed. We would stay here again and would recommend Kristina to future guests.

This place was great for what my friend and I were looking for studio with a bed, couch, TV, bath, and kitchen, in a safe neighbourhood and close to the subway. Although we did not meet our hosts because our schedules were different, Chris and Kristina were very responsive over email, checking in to make sure everything was ok. The only feedback I had for them was to put a bathmat out in the shower which they did as soon as possible. My only other feedback for them would be to replace the shower head from one that sprays everywhere it is a small shower, so with the shower head that sprays everywhere, its hard to find a place in that shower where youre not directly under the water to one that you can control the spray and that you can move. But thats not a big deal. Otherwise, everything was great. Thanks

Nevertheless, the communication was excellent and they were very understanding about my needs.brbrAPARTMENT The unit is in great shape, clean and comfortable. I was traveling alone, and it was more than adequate for a single business traveler a couple would also be very well served. The KITCHEN is great. There is a small dinette set, a dishwasher, small refrigerator, stove  oven and microwave. There was a toaster and coffee maker. I used the coffee maker each morning with some Dunkin Donuts coffee that was kindly provided by the hosts.  LIVING  BEDroom combination is comfortable. Though I am not much of TV person, for those who are interested, there is a flatscreen with cable service and a DVD player with a nice selection of movies. The host has also provided a small selection of reading material. Within the space there is an armchair, sofa and bed. The bed was quite comfortable with lots of foam pillows yay no feathers and a very cozy comforter. The BATHROOM is accessed by a folding door. It is small a small space, but has everything you will need. The shower has very good water pressure and plenty of very hot water. brbrAREA The unit is located off Centre St. in the Jamaica Plain area. It was very well situated for my needs. Parking is a nightmare throughout the entire city of Bostonthere is really no other way to describe it This unit does not have offstreet parking, so you will need to hunt for a space. There is a 2hr daytime  nolimit nighttime public lot off Centre St. with lots of spaces, abou Website hidden by Airbnb minute walk. Since I returned to the unit rather late each day, I found it easier just to park in the public lot and walk, rather than drive around looking for a space.brbrCONCLUSION If the location of this unit meets your needs, you will find an inviting space that far exceeds hotel accommodations. Is there any reason to stay at a hotel when you can stay at a wellrun AirBnB None whatsoever

Great place in a wonderful neighborhood with lots to do within walking distance or by easily accessible public transit. The design of the studio includes a completely separate and private entrance, so you do not have direct interaction with your hosts unless you seek it out.

The bed is amazingly comfortable and the baseball decor throughout the studio is great Highly recommend.

Jamaica Plain has a great selection of restaurants, a Whole Foods about a 15 minute walk away, and great spots to enjoy nature like Jamaica Pond and the Arnold Arboretum.

Though at first i had a little concern about the area as it doesnt look that decent, then i was feeling safe when i saw it is right next to the police station. And the house looks warm, one thing i liked about it is i can go to the kitchen and look for snacks when i feel hungry at night, that just feels like home.

Herminas house is huge, clean, and quiet. There are many rooms within the house that are rented out through AirBnB, however, I almost never saw or heard anyone. This was perfect for me as I came to Boston for interviews and to work on my thesis for a couple of days. The kitchen area is perfect to cook for yourself and they provide lots of ingredients for a tasty breakfast. Both Hermina and Donna are helpful, nice, and quick to respond to inquiries. The area around the house may seem a bit sketchy, but I never felt unsafe because there are usually lots of people and cars around. Furthermore, the Red Line train is 2 blocks away, which takes you directly to downtown Boston in 20 min. Thanks

Herminas Victorian home is lovely. She was not there during my stay, however, and so I had to be pretty independent, which I do not mind. There were other guests there I could hear them but we did not cross paths much at all. The location is very convenient to the Red Line which is a big plus. The neighborhood is quiet and quaint with a couple restaurants within a block or 2. brbrMaking sure the house manager is there to answer questions or give a tour would have been nice. We ran out of toilet paper and I had no idea where to get more. I also think another guest brought home fresh straight from the sea, still alive fish the first night, so for about 18 hours the entire house smelled of dead fish  very, very unpleasant. Another guest continuously left the toilet seat up. Every single time. A house manager could have helped remedy these situation where it may be uncomfortable for another guest to rectify it. Also, because the doors are controlled with a code entry, I wasnt sure how safe it was.  I did lock myself out of the bedroom unknowingly and had to contact Hermina to figure out how to get back in. She was very responsive and told me where the keys were. Still, providing a key to each bedroom upfront would have been great. Having access to everyones bedroom keys was probably not the safest thing for a guest to have. brbrThe room I stayed in room D was gorgeous, clean and very comfortable. I spent my time in the home in my little oasis the room and found my self most satisfied there. I would recommend Herminas place with the full disclosure above.

The home and room were as described. Very close to the subway and stores to pick up basic essentials. It is located in a very rough neighbourhood, so we made sure to get home before 8pm. I wouldnt feel comfortable walking around at night by myself, but it was ok with my partner. The home is located in front of a police station which came with sirennoise but also an added sense of security when sleeping at night.

Our family of 3 spent 2 nights at this home during a weekend getaway. Hermina, the hostess, was very hospitable and present. We appreciated meeting her and knowing that she was there if we needed her. The home was as it appeared in its listing. Our room was clean and comfortable, and we appreciated the use of the fridge, kitchen and dining area. Also we enjoyed the advice from Hermina for where to get groceries  a 5minute walk  where to eat  a Vietnamese restaurant close by  and some highlights to look for in historic Boston. The only downside for our family of 3 was the noise. The street was fairly busy with traffic at night and the other guests were quite noisy. One guest arrived very late each evening and wore loud shoes as she walked up the stairs to the loft room above us not respectful of her, and another guest had a baby whose midnight crying woke all of us up we love babies  having had 2 of our own  but it was unfortunate for us to be lodged at close quarters with a loud crying baby the night prior to doing an 8hour drive. My advice to others wishing to stay at Herminas home is bring earplugs It will be a comfortable sleep and a good base for visiting Boston.

I had a wonderful stay at the Treetop Haven in Jamaica Plain. The neighbourhood is very nice, and has easy access to the city center. The fact that the studio was on top of the house gave privacy as well as proximity to the homeowners for any help I needed.

A great place to stay We were a party of two and stayed at Treetop Haven for 4 nights at the end of September.  The apartment is absolutely adorable.  Its comfortable, bright, clean and quiet.  There is a private entrance and private bathroom.   The bed is very comfortable.  The kitchen is fully equipped with small versions of all the basic appliances rangeoven, microwave, kettle, fridge which allowed us to make meals in the apartment we even baked storebought cookies one night.  The private and relatively large patio with outdoor seating is a huge plus.  It makes the apartment feel a little bit bigger, gives you access to the outdoors and is very pleasant to spend time on.  Cable TV and a fast wifi connection are available in the apartment.  We met Maria on the first day and then had complete privacy for the rest of our stay.   When we needed more toilet paper, it appeared immediately.  The location is superb in a charming and vibrant neighborhood of JP, close to great restaurants, bars and cafes.  The neighborhood is very safe we didnt have any concerns even at night.  We had a rental car and parking was no problem.  Public transport bus or subway is a couple of blocks away if you need it.  Its not far to the center of Boston.   I will definitely stay here again when I return to Boston. Its a gem of a place.  I highly recommend it.  Take note that this is an upper apartment so there are stairs to climb to get to the entrance.  In our case, it was perfect as it added to the privacy.  Thanks Maria

A full equipped kitchen, a private bathroom and a sleeping area with a table for eatstudio. It has a big deck that I was not able to use due to heavy snow during those month. I used to call this the Hobbit apartment because it is pretty and cosy has the hobbit house. Convenient located near the T and the Bus, you will be at Boston center in 1020 minutes. The area has everything you may need coffe shop, supermarket, restaurants, laundry.... brMaria Elena and his family were very friendly but have me all the privacy I needed. brI would absolutely recommend this place to everyone going to Boston and I will definitely stay here if I return again to the city.

My  husband and I stayed at Maria Elenas place for almost a month as we were in the process of moving out of state.  It was the perfect temporary home base for us to get tofrom work and relax at night as we both tried to wrap things up.   We didnt require much, but we knew we could check in with Maria Elena if we needed anything.  The space was convenient for cooking some small meals.  Due to late nights working and because we wanted to eat at our favorite places one last time before we fully moved, we ended up eating out a lot.  The neighborhood has really great options that are within walking distance.  We did laundry several times during our stay and the laundromat was just a few blocks away.  We didnt have a car, so this was helpful.  The Orange line and 39 bus are easily accessible from the airbnb. We also utilized UberLyft to get to places just to save time.

Me and my husband had a great stay at Howards house last April. He was very nice and helpful. Both the room and the bathroom were very clean and the bed was really comfortable. For some it might be an issue that the bathroom is in the hall but for us it was not a problem, we felt we were totally alone in the house as Howard lives on another floor.

We were on a flying visit to Boston for a few days, our first visit...what a great city. It was all made very special by our stay at Meris lovely apartment. It is in a very nice, friendly neighbourhood and a perfect location to take a cab from or walk into the city. The apartment is beautifully appointed  the best shower, quality bed linen and towels. Meri was very helpfull and responsive to any questions we had. As recommended, we had a super brunch in The Paramount and the best seafood in The Legal Website hidden by Airbnb good we went there twice  Bostonians are the friendliest people weve experienced in all our travels. So this was a trip well remember and hope to repeat sometime soon. Thanks Meri

The photos in the listing are accurate and the condo was clean and well maintained. The surrounding neighborhood is nice, with close proximity to the beach and nice walkingrunning paths. We had some difficulties with parking but working with Meri it came to a good conclusion. Check in and check out was simple and painless. House rules were simple and unobtrusive.brbrWhile the listing states it accommodates 3, it truly accommodates the number of people you want to put into the 2 closed bedrooms. Our group consisted of 3 individuals in Boston to attend a conference and each sleeping separately no couples. We set up the air mattress comfortable and easy to set up in the living room downstairs. We had a really hard time balancing the heating so that the person downstairs was comfortable and those upstairs were not too hot. There are also no curtainsblinds in the living room, so there is little privacy for anyone sleeping on the air mattress in the living room and there is a street lamp just outside the window that stays on overnight.brbrAll in all, I would return as a small group2 couples not needing the air mattress and using the two bedrooms with comfortable beds.

Home is very comfortable but it does require walking up stairs both to get to it and once inside bedrooms are upstairs and the bathroom is on the main floor The air mattress that was provided was perfect for my kids and much appreciated and comfortableeasy to use Kitchen was well stocked with anything you need to cook. We enjoyed the back patio at night as well. I would defiantly recommend this home Thanks Meri for opening it up to our family. Boston was GREAT

Hermina was very sweet and helpful.  She took my friend to the market with her and gave her a lay of the land which my friend was very happy about.

First, the positives, the apartment we were in Apt. 2, is right next to a police station so you do feel safe.  You are within a five minute walk from the Fields Corner T station and you can be anywhere in Boston in 30 minutes.  You are close to shopping and a very nice restaurant, The Blarney Stone.  Also the beds were comfortable.brNow the negatives, the Dortchester neighborhood is pretty low income, unclean, with half of the storefronts vacant.  It is improving but slowly.  Take a look at the Wiki page for this neighborhood before you rent.  We did, however, feel safe walking around.  The apartment is as pictured, but  was unclean in the kitchen area and the upstairs bathroom.  The towels were thin and used, and there were no washcloths.  The wood flooring in the main level was squishy and we avoided walking on certain areas for fear of breaking it.  The house is Victorian but this back apartment had no Victorian features.  Also, there is a lack of curtains in the kitchen, upper bath and upper hallway.brAlthough we had a great trip to Boston and the apartment was habitable, we would not recommend.

Before we arrived we got a document that had all required information on it, which was very helpful. brbrThe house itself was  nice and clean with very good beds and two restrooms. It is very close to the red line T station and a grocery store. There is also a nice place to eat nearby the Blarney Stone. If you dont mind to go to downtown Boston by T than it is a very good place to stay. We enjoyed it.brbrYou can also rent her car if you want which is nice if you want to go out for a day.

My boyfriend and I are very happy that we chose to stay with Hilary, Hazel, and Aggie while we were in Boston this past weekend. We were in town for job interviews and a conference at the Hynes, and it was so nice to have a quiet, warm, and friendly place to retire to at the end of each day. As we were trudging around the city in the cold, I kept envisioning our cozy little room and wanting to go back to it asap, it was so inviting I had never done the private room option on airbnb before, since I imagined it might be awkward well, this was not awkward at all The vibe at the house is very comfortable, and we felt right at home. The whole family is so nice we enjoyed chatting with Hilary in the morning while getting our breakfast, and as you will read about in the other reviews as well, Aggie is the sweetest, most friendly dog you can imagine this coming from a selfprofessed cat person I would love to have a dog like Aggie any day. As for the location, that was great too. Transportation to the convention center was super easy and took about 20 minutes the bus is right down the street, and it comes all the time. The subway is just as close too, making it very easy to explore anywhere around the city. We also really liked downtown JP, just a very short walk away.

Hilary was an incredible host. We were with her for 8 days. Full of great tips, ideas, warmth and care.

The Sam Adams brewery is 10 mins away walking, that was so much fun The subway station is really close, and a bus we also used. All in all, an excellent stay Thank you

This IS such a sweet little house I fell in love with the character and artistic atmosphere. And Hilary and Hazel were great hosts. Hilary was more than willing to suggest local places to go and some of the most underrated things to see in Boston. The room was small but cozy, and actually just perfect for travelers who just need a place to sleep. Jamaica Plain is such an awesome neighborhood, which I never would have discovered had we stayed in touristy downtown. This price is a steal for the all around lovely experience we had.

Hilary and her family were so warm and welcoming to us  and since it was our first time in Boston, that was really nice to havebrbrHer home is clean and cozy and I pretty much made tea for myself everyday with comfort. brbrHer area JP is also a gem in Boston  if we stayed in a hotel downtown we would have never gone to JP. JP has some of the very best restaurants and overall a convenient area. If you come to Boston, whether you stay in JP or not, its worth a day trip just to go out there

The place is just oke, but the people are very kindfull The conversations made us feel at home. Hilary knows a lot about the city and is very helpfull and interesting in where we went to. The house is close to lots of restaurants and to the public transport. The neighbourhood is quiet and safe and also very beautiful with the colourfull houses. The bedroom is small and the bed as well. For a Dutch tall guy 1.95 m too short. The house is a little bit old, but we like to stay there. Most of all Hilary is a great host.

Staying at Hilarys place was just wonderful. The house is very comfortable and cosy. It has wonderful, colourful atmosphere with lovely ceramics and paintings and collections of found objects.

I would definitely stay here again if I were to come to Boston Hilary and Hazel were great hosts.

Hilary is amazingly responsive. She sent me everything I needed to know before I arrived including step by step public transit instructions for my husband and I we were coming from separate locations.  She answered all my questions by email very quickly and she answered when I called her by phone as well. She is intelligent, kind, and friendly.  She wasnt there when I arrived which she had communicated to me via email, but gave me instructions to use the lock box for the key, left me a note, and book of maps, menus, and brochures, which was very helpful.  The book also included the WiFi password which works great and tips about the house including where she keeps the coffee and tea.  I didnt need to ask for a thing, she is clearly a seasoned Airbnb host and has this down to a science.brI would stay with Hilary again and plan to if Im ever in Boston again. Everything was as expecteddescribed or better.  She has a charming single family old Victorian style home, with all the modern conveniences.  As typical with older homes, the bedroom was on the small side although seemed bigger than pictured and there wasnt a closet.  There is a tall empty bookcase in the bedroom, where we kept most of our things and there is space under the bed for your suitcases.  There were small end tables on each side of the bed as well. My husband was with me and we felt like we had plenty of space.  brThe home was clean, towels were fresh and fluffy, and the bedding was warm and comfortable. The home is heated by a thermostat, but you also have your own room heater which we didnt need, the home was a comfortable temperature for us.  She has hardwood and stone floors, which tend to be cold, so if you travel there in the winter bring a pair of slippers. brThe neighborhood is so adorable The houses are beautiful Victorian works of art and there is a hipster vibe.  I walked all over Jamaica Plain checking out shops and restaurants that Hilary kindly recommended. Everything is pretty much shut down by 9 or 10, not much of a nightlife there.  But the Orange line, which is walking distance from Hilarys about a half mile runs late and frequently on Friday evening.  It takes about 30 minutes to get downtown on the orange line. To the airport it takes  maybe 4560 mins, you need to switch form the orange line to the blue line. It was very easy to get around on the T.br

Although we unfortunately didnt get a chance to meet Hilary during our she made us feel Email hidden by Airbnb munication was good leading up to our stay and she was even able to accommodate an early check in to suit our travel plans.  We were provided with a big book of things to do and places to eat in JP and Boston. The house itself is beautiful filled with arts and crafts and the room small but cozy. The back garden is a nice place to just sit and relax with a book. The location is great on a quite street which is just a few minutes walk from the main restaurant strip of Jamaica Plain or the TStation to easily get around Boston. I would absolutely recommend anyone travelling to Boston.

Hilary and Hazel are such lovely people. We felt very welcome from the moment we walked into their house. Hilary emailed me a few days before we were scheduled to arrive with detailed instructions on how to get to her house from South Station. She was very helpful providing maps and booklets on the different things there is to do in Boston. Her house is very cozy and made us feel like we were home. The room is small but very relaxing.

We had a great time in Boston and Hilary and Hazel were a big part of that They made us feel very welcome in their beautiful home and were very accommodating.

Jamaica plain is a wonderful little area of Boston Im glad we got to explore, and its location is extremely convenient when commuting by public transit. Only a short walk and one train to get right downtown The room was exactly as posted, very cozy and a perfect amount of space for us to rest our heads after a long day of sight seeing I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Hilarys home is located in a very beautiful and quiet block. There is Jamaica Pond nearby which is so amazing. Hilary is so kind. She gave us much travel advices. The room is a little small for two person but for one is OK. Thank you for Hilary and Hazel. And Aggie is so cute.

We had a great time in Hilarys little house. She warmly welcomed us with tons of tourist information which is very useful, and let us have some free tea and coffee. She even made brunch for us The house is close enough to the train station, and the neighborhood Jamaica Plain is the coolest area in Boston like Williamsburg in NYC. One thing I should let the other guests know is that the room is pretty small so if you have more than two large suitcases, it might be difficult to fit them inWe had one big and one normal suitcase and it was already full. But overall, I can strongly recommend her house of your stay in Boston

We stayed at Hillarys place for three days and were welcomed on the first day by Hazel, Hillarys daughter. Since we had an overnight flight, she did her best to accommodate us before check in time. Both, Hazel and Hillary were very nice they also shared with us a delicious pie and homemade baked sweets and they had a lot of recommendations for Boston. As described, the room is rather small, but they let us leave one of our bags in the hallway. It can get a bit hot during the night, but there is a fan in a room and if needed, Hillary can also turn on the AC.

My parents and I stayed in Guys place for two weeks, and we loved it We were out sightseeing most of the time, but enjoyed all the time we spent at home too. We were a little surprised at first because it is a basement apartment, but there are big windows that let in lots of sunlight and it is on a quiet street, so not at all noisy. Plus, it was kind of cozy It had a great heating system we went in winter and the temperature was always comfortable. The beds were both very comfortable, and the couchbed was easy to use and figure out. The apartment is decorated nicely and tastefully, and was very clean. It is also in a very central location, only a 5 minute walk to the nearest T station and to Boston Common and lots of shopping.

I was very busy during my stay in Boston, so the quality of my lodging was not a high priority. The location was perfect for my needs, as was the price.

Had I needed to spend time in my apartment beyond sleeping, I would have been very uncomfortable.

Definitely read all of the reviews before booking if you are very particular about where you are staying. We stayed in the first floor room which wasnt bad its extremely old and pretty quirky but overall a large room and the apartment is on a BEAUTIFUL street and in a perfect location. The bathroom was VERY DIRTY  it literally a layer of dirt on the floor. The rest of the house was just as the reviews said.. full of books and smelled kind of funny. Robert was very nice even though we only met him briefly. They were also very accommodating and let us leave our luggage until later in the evening.

This home away from home was the perfect place for our trip. We had a group of 6 people of all ages, and there was more than plenty of space for all of us. Very reasonably priced for the space and location. Next time I go to the Boston area, I plan to stay here again. The only small concern we had with the place was the rug in the dining room. It was very slick against the floor and nearly every time someone walked to the table with food, they would have to catch their balance. Definitely a minor issue, just more of a concern for people staying in the future. Otherwise perfect

Beautiful place to stay It is quite the trek from the Tstation and the house, and even though there is parking on the premises, I strongly encourage courage publiccab transportation.

Lance was great in getting out water heater fixed immediately after it went out and after that our stay was smooth sailing. Parking is a breeze with your own driveway and the neighbors were so nice Thanks again

I had a fantastic experience with this apartment. Our host was flexible with our checkin time, and we had no complaints during our stay. Also, the balcony overlooking downtown Boston was really neat. I would definitely stay at this location again.

The appartment was absolutely great and very clean, all furbished, only a little bit noisy but then, Boston is a large city with a lot of traffic, so I suppose this cant be avoided. Messages from our host on what we should do on arrival and departure were very clear and we had a wonderful stay.

Lovely penthouse suite at the top of a grand, old Boston home.  It is on a very nice street with other such buildings.  Decor was comfortable and modern.  I really liked the firm memory foam mattresses and the fact that one of the bedrooms is completely internal so I could get away from the lights and sounds of the road.  brOnly downsides were that if you walk a street either direction it can feel like a different world, and the stairs were narrow in line with an older home, which made it difficult to carry luggage updown.  Overall excellent stay and would definitely stay there again.

This house is absolutely beautiful. It was definitely more than we were expecting. The pictures dont do justice to what you will experience. We were not happy about leaving.brOur only downfall was that the bedrooms were divided by curtains  a slide door that couldnt be locked at least we couldnt figure it out brBut overall it was definitely a great weekend

Lance is an absolutely horrible property manager. My emails, messages, and phone callsvoicemails to Lance himself, along with Swank Properties, went unanswered for 12 DAYS. There were issues with water pressure within the unit, the grill did not function, nor did the surround sound  all listed as amenities mind you. I was not able to utilize water similtaneously within the unit through the duration of my stay. In other words, if someone was doing dishes, you couldnt shower. If laundry was running, you could barley wash your hands. After finally getting a hold of Lance, he responded sarcastically referencing water pressure not meeting my satisfaction. Along with the lack of amenities, Swank continuously deferred me to Air BNB over compensation. You cannot reach Swank Properties directly  it is literally impossible. You get directed to a call service, where I left messages over 12 days. I did not hear back from the property manager Lance of my unit for 12 DAYS. I could barely shower throughout this time. Nothing was resolved, and I moved out. Please understand that Swank Properties is absolutely awful at what they do. I am deleting my air bnb account over all of this, as I am still not being compensated for the listed amenities not functioning, inability to shower at times, and lack of responsiveness with ZERO compensation.

This place is a hidden gem. Its perfect. Location. Decor. The place is beautiful. I feel like they put a lot of thought into decorating the space with nice pieces. Super sunny. Private. Its surprisingly quiet. The bed is really comfortable. The balcony is great. Perfect for tanning and watching the sunset. I love this place. It was a win. Checking In and Out was easy and done mobile. I think the people that manage this property do an excellent job.

Its a nice spacious apartment with an amazing view over downtown Boston. Rooms were good as well and three of us visiting Boston for a business had a nice stay there. The place is about 10 min walk from the Red Line station which takes to central Boston, Harvard and elsewhere. Conference venue was about 40 min distance for us, but the length of it was compensated by the pleasures of the apartment, plus price as well, which is significantly less than anything close to the centre. The area itself was pretty residential and had not many cafes but the apartment itself was really spatious and with a porch or how to really call it, so excellent for drinking coffee there and enjoying morning sun. During our 10 day stay there was a small issue with a leak from the roof, but Lance sorted it out fast and it was not a major problem. All in all, we enjoyed our stay there

Communication is severely lacking at this place. First, the thermostat was not working and I requested extra blankets for the next night because of the freezing temperatures in the house. Instead of providing them, they sent me an email saying that blankets could not be provided and that the thermostat was working fine. I cant believe they didnt even have the decency to call me back, and refused to listen to the customer. My entire family was cold for the next two nights. And if I may add, the blankets at the place werent enough for the amount of people they said they could accommodate. Some blankets also had visible stains over it. Secondly, theyre only able to answer you during office hours Monday to Friday. Other than that, you have to pray and hope they respond to your voicemail. Thirdly, no shampoo or body wash was provided. There was no TOILET PAPER in the bathroom. Oh, and the airbnb locked me out after a certain time and I had to leave a voicemail to get my luggage back. How is it that a vacation turned out to be more stressful than work

We stayed at 12 Peverell St for 7 nights. The rental listing could use some updated pictures along with several other updates. The shower has a full size window with no shadecurtain, neighbors are getting a free show especially in the winter when the leaves fall off the tree. The floor around the toilet is stained yellow and smells of urine really bad. The cleaning lady came during our stay and cleaned but she would have to rip out the floors to get rid of that smell. The beds are hard and the box springs squeak with every move. The futon in the living room is lumpy and hard. The 3rd bedroom is on the second floor with a door that cannot close all the way. Same with the bedroom upstairs, door will not stay closed. Oh and becareful when grabbing the door handles, they come right off the door. We will never use swank Properties again. This place is not home away from home.

Margaret is a very helpful and pleasant host. She willingly shares her knowledge of Boston and the surrounding areas.  She has a friendly energetic dog, so this is ideal for dog lovers. The rooms are on the second floor up some winding stairs so not great if your mobility is limited. One enters through the back door into the kitchen. Both bedrooms are good sized and share a second floor bathroom.  It is sort of like having a private suite, as Margarets room is on the third floor.  There are groceries, cages and restaurants within easy walking distance. The walk to the T subway is no more than 10 minutes. Very convenient location. Would not hesitate to stay again if I went back. Im still thinking about those clams, Margaret

We are a couple in our 60s, and were trying airbnb for the first time. So a little nervous. But it turned out that the accommodation was very attractive, just like staying in your own condo. Lots of room in a modern stylish home. The neighborhood is upscale compared to many others in Boston, and all was as advertised. Off street parking right outside our own private entrance was an unexpected bonus. The host made us feel very welcome and not like a tenant.  He is friendly and helpful but not nosy  just the right balance.  brbrHe suggested a place just down the street  a five minute walk for breakfast one morning, and it turned out to be a fabulous neighborhood experience.

First of all, this rental is a full unit rental, so you dont need to, and most likely wont interact with the owner at all.  I dont have the slightest problem with that.

Has two rooms, bathroom, living room, dinning room, kitchen and a small room on the back.  The view of the city is also quite good.brWarning to older travelers its on a third floor, and no elevator since its an old building.  So if you are carrying huge luggage you might struggle.brDorchester might not be the best neighborhood of Boston, but this particular area of Dorchester is quite good it is safe, reasonably clean, reasonably close to the T and there are buses there too if you dont want to walk, close to a shopping mall which includes a grocery supermarket and to several small restaurants next to a very good one actually.brI would definitively stay here again.

Unfortunately, the was the worst Airbnb experience I have ever had. First, the host is very slow at responding so when my check in code was incorrect, it was not until I reached out to Airbnb that I received a response. When I entered the entire space was filthy furniture including the couch, dining room chairs, rugs and even spaces in the kitchen were covered with dog hair. There are dirt stains on every wall that realistically need a professional cleaning or new paint job. The bathtub was brown, the shower curtain was mildewy and the bedroom sheets were stained. The mattress itself has an egg carton topper so you feel like it is a college dorm and when leaving you can reveal the horror of what you were sleeping on top of. The comforter provided was a duvet cover without an insert. The host did offer an additional cleaning service but it was still uncomfortably dirty in a way that led me to cancel and check out early still tons of dog hair, stains on walls unable to be cleaned off, much of the furniture is damaged and dirty. Some of the furniture in the listing is inaccurate to the listing photos including the desk that has been replaced by a cot in a closet that only a serial killer would feel comfortable sleeping on. The kitchen is fully stocked but the items are also old and damaged. Overall, I was very disappointed in the space and the host which lead to a good deal of distress while needing a stay working as a healthcare worker in Boston. There are better places to stay worth your money than this one. I would encourage any one thinking about booking to look through reviews of other listings to get a better sense of the host and his hospitality. Finally, after checking out and driving 4 hours to return home for the weekend, my boyfriend asked my why my clothes smelled and I had to admit it was from living in this space for two weeks. The listing is misleading and if you chose to stay, beware that the host will only leave a half bottle of soap and one roll of toilet paper for you in a long term stay I have received better amenities in weekend airbnb stays. To be fair, there were no bugs or mice that I found so thats a plus and if youre okay with general filth than the location is also decent.

What a fantastic place I think as far as apartments in the Boston area go, this is as good a deal as you can find. Its located in a picturesque and safe neighborhood, pretty easy to get to even at night, and the apartment is just stunningly beautiful.

Flights were crazy on check in day and we ended up not checking in early as we requested, but Deborah was very accomodating to allow us had our flight arrived on time. Very serene and a great surprise for my son and husband  We loved the quietness, the uniqueness, and the decor.  We found a small market a few blocks away. We felt safe with the locked marina. Would definitely rent again

this was a fun and unique location to share for the weekend. although a compact space it was all we needed... even with 6 adults.  the description is very accurate about the location and the noise but we were not bothered by it. I would totally recommend this place and stay here again if plans bring me back to Boston.

Best way to see Boston Had such a wonderful experience on the house boat. Just beautiful setting. Fabulous host

The Blue Pearl is really ideally located. So much history to explore in Charlestown, the North End just a walk over the bridge, and a quick ferry ride to other points downtown. And the waterfront walkway was perfect for a stroll with our dog. It was a scorcher the weekend we were there but the breeze off the water was nice and the ac kept us cool.

Joes apartment was lovely and Im so glad we made the decision to stay in Charlestown.  Its a great area, perfect for starting the Freedom Trail as the Beacon Hill monument is only a couple of minutes walk away.  There T stop is about 10 minutes walk away, but theres a huge Whole Foods supermarket on the way  very handy for food shopping. You hardly need the T though as it only take about 15 minutes to walk across the bridge to North End great restaurants.brbrThe apartment is lovely  really nice and spacious with a proper kitchen.

We had a great experience staying here for a few days after a family wedding. The location in Charlestown was fantastic  a quiet residential street close to everything we wanted to see. We were able to walk everything very easily. The apartment had everything we needed and was comfortable. The TV, wifi, coffee maker, hot water, etc. all worked fine. We could hear people walking and talking upstairs during the day, but not to the point where it bothered us. I think that is to be expected anywhere in the city. Its different than a hotel, but not bad. Joe was an excellent host and was very accommodating. We would definitely stay here again.

Joe is a generous, outgoing, and thoughtful person who seeks to do all he can for his tenants. A most likeable person, he went out of his way not only to pick us up at the airport but also to drive through heavy Friday afternoon traffic to take us back there I dont think he can do this each and every time, and nothing in our arrangement with him obliged him to do so. His flat in Charlestown is comfortable, not fancy, but has everything you need save for a working oven, which Joe is seeking to fix. All facilities work, the bed is comfortable, the neighborhood charming, the walk over to the Bunker Hill Monument a must, and Boston itself worth many hours of investigation.

Joes apartment was just as we expected. The only surprise was that the bedroom was between the living and kitchen, but it was not a problem.brIt was a lovely area, and very quiet.brIts an old house, filled with period furniture, and very few mod cons, but we liked it that way. The lovely big sleigh bed, which he told us he rescued from being thrown out, was extremely comfortable.brJoe loves to talk, and we enjoyed listening to his stories. We wanted to a visit a cemetery, and he gave us a lift there, and also took us to the airport on the day we left.brWe got talking about family, my hobby is genealogy and I ended up volunteering to research his family tree.brAll in all, Joe was was a very good host, and we would recommend him to other couples looking for accommodation in Boston.brbrBy the time we left we felt like we had made a new friend.br

Joe is a great guy, interesting and helpful.  His rental is just 2 stars.  Its adequate and conveniently located in Charlestown, but it has shortcomings.  It was cold. The drawers in the bedroom and kitchen were full of odd stuff, like a cold chisel. The kitchen was minimally stocked with cooking implements  Joe mentioned he doesnt encourage much cooking in there  so dont plan on more than scrambling some eggs and making coffee. TV is rabbit ears not cable or Directv.   Bathroom is very small.  Overall it was just ok, but were not likely to return.

This was our second stay with Gerard and Marie, and again we found them to be extremely friendly and helpful.  The apartment was just as before clean, bright and relaxing.  This time at Maries suggestion we took the ferry to Boston each day.  At only 3 per person each way it was an inexpensive yet beautiful way to reach the city.  The ferry stop was only about a 12 minute walk from the apartment through quaint Charlestown.  We also had dinner at Tangierino on Saturday night what an experience  Belly dancers and great food all within a short walk to the apartment  If youre thinking about a trip to Boston, I highly recommend Gerard and Maries apartment.

My family of four stayed in Gerard and Maries place for five nights. It was a very clean and comfortable apartment. There was plenty of room for the four of us with my husband and I sleeping in the bedroom, one of our teenaged children sleeping on the pullout couch and the other sleeping on the blowup mattress. Gerard and Marie were easy to contact, and although they live right upstairs, we never heard them. It was very private. Theres even a small private patio in the back. We enjoyed the peace and quiet of staying in Charlestown as opposed to Boston proper however, be aware that you do have to walk a bit to get to restaurants and the subway. Our favorite restaurant in Charlestown was Figs  about a 10 minute walk from the apartment  which has amazing pizza.

Two and a half bathrooms   what a luxury  The house was spotless and the beds were all comfortable with lots of pillow choices.  The 39 bus and the green line T are both within easy reach.

I feel like the best feedback I can give is that on my next trip to Boston, I would  stay here again.  The room is small and sweet.  The house quiet and surrounded by trees and comes with two gentle cats.  JP is a great part of Boston with a diverse population and a pond to run around almost exactly 3 miles from this house that is a nice break from work meetings all day in the city.  Lisa is a great hostkind, funny, and is the type who will invite you to dinner but not be annoyed if you say no.  It was a nice change from staying in a sterile hotel room.

Our hostess was wonderful. Very downtoearth and accommodating. We had a little miscommunication on the first day of our arrival, but she graciously comped us a night and quickly righted things. She has two lovely, sweet cats and a very friendly significant other The neighborhood was awesome. We loved Jamaica Plain. Its a quirky, upandcoming area with a lot of character. Overall, we highly enjoyed our stay.

Lisa was very accommodating. Her house is charming and the room was comfortable. Space is a little tight, but thats New England for you Im not going to hold Lisa responsible for that Lisas pets are very cute and friendly. There is a faint parfum de chat, but nothing so intense you cant forget about it. Lisas home is singlehandedly saving the environment and she provides a list of how you can help ensure that this continues while staying with her. I didnt see her much, but she was super great with communication. I would certainly recommend and stay again myself.

Lisa and John were such lovely, goodhearted people. I cant say enough how they made me feel right at home. I stayed there for a week while looking for apartments. There were a few special favors I needed to request of them that wouldve been completely within their rights to decline, but they went above and beyond to welcome me to the great city of Boston free computer charging service Haha. I would definitely recommend a friend to stay with them. brbrThe location is a very easy walk to public transportation and restaurants etc. Jamaica plain is a beautiful, quiet town with a lot of personality. brbrIt took one flight of stairs to get to my room, and they had everything I needed to feel comfortable toiletries, towels, dresser. I especially liked the lights directly over the bed  The bed was good, and thats saying a lot since I have a really bad back and rarely can sleep on a bed thats not mine. brbrThe bathroom is shared and I never had to wait more than a minute to use it. The cats do tend to like to sneak into your room if you dont keep it closed, which I found adorable  but it is something to be aware of. brbrbr

Lisa and John were very welcoming and friendly. It felt private and there was plenty of space, even though you share a bathroom and living area.

Lisa was a wonderful host for my parents. She made them feel extremely comfortable and welcome. Both my parents are very happy to have made great friends with Lisa. The house and room were very well kept. She openheartedly offered her kitchen for use. The neighborhood was like a cherry on the icing.

Lisas listing description was informative and accurate, so there were no surprises. In addition, both Lisa and John were welcoming and hospitable and instantly made my husband and I feel comfortable and at home. We very much enjoyed making meals in Lisas bright, sunny kitchen, and her home is located an easy 68 min walk to the T. Best of all were the interesting conversations  Lisa and John were the loveliest of company. Although they were always respectful of our privacy also. brbrIt is noted that the room is small, but my husband and I were comfortable even with a month plus worth of luggage and accessories. We kept our belongings contained and spent the majority of our time enjoying Boston, in the kitchen, or comfortably watching television from bed

Lisa and John have a beautiful place in the heart of one of the cutest and, quite frankly, more unexpected neighbourhoods in the Boston area. Its so close to the Orange line, which is one of the prettiest and oldest heavy rail subway lines in North America. Their house has so much character and charm to it that we were quite jealous by the end of our 2 night stay. John provided us with so many tips and quips about Boston and Jamaica Plain that we wouldnt have been able to Hidden by Airbnb ourselves. Our first night was very warm and humid in the room since the AC hadnt been put in the window understandable seeing as it was early June but Lisa and John were still able to hook us up with a small fan for the night which made it much more tolerable. All in all, a fantastic place for those who enjoy transit, parks, small shops and good eats. Thanks for welcoming us properly in to Boston

What can I say Sami was a remarkable host. My son and I has traveled to Boston to watch a game with out any reservations. Just because I didnt have an idea of what to do after. I had contacted Sami after the game and he opened his home to us. Sami is a very nice and pleasant host, my son loved his cat. It was nice to talk to him and get to know him a little on a personal basis. brNow as for the room, it was perfect for us. We slept on a bunk bed. The room can be small if you have a lot of luggage and bed small if your tall. You be about 20 min from the ball park and 30 from bus station. I uber to get around and it was easy and affordable.

This apartment was quaint but minimalist and was in a great location for walking around the North End area of Boston. Which is so cute Jose was accessible and we were able to reach him as soon as we arrived in town, and he helped us with directions when we got lost The bed was comfortable soft sheets, water pressure was goodhot, towels were clean and the apartment was sufficient for our stay  which did not revolve around spending much time in the apartment. The only thing I will say, is that the apt. decor was a bit more scarce than pictured  no rugs, no curtains on some of the windows. Not the end of the world  but I was expecting it to look as pictured.

As per previous reviews,the position of the apartment was perfect and we loved being in the midst of Bostons Little Italy. brbrYou do have to go up three flights of stairs and it is narrow so dont have too much luggage and it may not be suitable for more mature travellers with knee or back problems.brbrIt was unfortunate that on our first and last nights at this apartment, we had problems with the bathroom toilet and had to go down the street to the local cafes to use their facilities. This was very inconvenient and frustrating.brbrAs it had been reported previously by a prior traveller, we were disappointed that it wasnt fixed.brbrJose did attend to it first thing in the morning but the problem reoccurred. Thank goodness we were leaving anyway and he assured us that it would be fixed.brbr Hopefully, it has been sorted out by now.brbrI have to say that the support of Airbnb was great, though, at 2.30am in the morning, wishing us to have a great day was not the best way to show empathy This was after wed been up for an hour cleaning up the mess and trying to get in touch with Jose to no avail and considering looking for alternate accommodation.brbrThanks to Airbnb for helping us out in a difficult situation and Jose did respond as quick as he could. For it to happen once during our stay is unfortunate. Twice is unacceptabe.brbrbrbrbr

This is a very convenient spot for people who are visiting Boston as tourists. Its location almost literally at the base of the Old North Church cant be beaten, with all of the North End and its great food and culture, as well as public transportation, a close overnight parking lot, the West End, the Financial District and the Haymarket area, all within easy walking distance. The space itself is basic, but serviceable for young 20something tourists who dont need to spend much time in it. It is relatively clean, though the bathroom sported some not very pleasant hair from a previous guest. It is not as wellsuited to business needs the wifi signal was not strong enough for a Hidden by Airbnb Hangout meeting we were supposed to have with a business client, and we had to cancel the meeting or family needs the floor is very thin and several very loud partying girls in the unit below us sounded like they were literally in bed with us late into the night, which made getting up at 5 am to make a flight at Logan after very little sleep difficult outlets without covers in the bedroom under the desk that could shock small, exploring hands a missing tile in the shower partially covered by plastic and fallingoff duct tape that would also be irresistible but not very safe for small exploring hands. Our host was very nice and responsive, so maybe he will finish off the unfinished bits of this space to make it a better value for the money and more suitable for different kinds of travelers.

The place is in a great location Lots of Italian restaurants a block away.  Also, it is a walking distance to Irish bars and restaurants.

Joses apartment was in a fantastic position  right on the Freedom Trail and within easy walking distance to the harbour and great shopping areas. The apartment is well designed, spacious and filled with light from all directions. The bedroom is large and the bed very comfortable. We just had an issue with the bathroom, which would benefit from some refurbishment. There is a tile missing near the shower and this seemed to cause a damp smell that was off putting. Some basic utensils eg. Plates and coffee cups were not provided, which was an inconvenience. If these two issues were sorted out, we would recommend staying there in future.

The apartment is in a perfect location unless you hate good food. In the North End you are right in the heart of Bostons Italian community.

Id also recommend Theos around the corner from the apartment for breakfast.

This location is great. We would have enjoyed it more if we hadnt arrived with bronchitis following a month long trip in Europe. The fourth floor walk up was hard on us. The stairs are very narrow and steep. We did not meet the owner. But again, being positive, the location is wonderful.

Jasons place was great Very clean and wellkept, and exactly as described. The location in the North End is pretty much perfect. Parking is not too far off about a 3 minute walk to the nearest garage, and the building was very quiet. The window AC unit provided some much needed coolingoff for us. The bed was comfy, the bathroom and kitchen very clean. Would highly recommend this place for anyone willing to navigate the few flights of stairs with their luggage.

The place was a perfect location for our vacation. It was amongst the cutest brick buildings and central to Little Italy. The building is a little old  we had to carry our luggages up 4 flights of narrow stairs. But other than that the apartment was pretty spacious for a couple. The host was nice and reported to any troubles right away. Overall, enjoyed our stay

The location of this apartment couldnt be better It is in a very charming area of historic Boston. We loved walking to restaurants  shops Jose was very responsive and communication was easy. The apartment is roomy. Bed is comfortable, sheets and towels clean. Although, the interior of the apartment felt like it needs alot of TLC. It felt dingy and smelled musty. The floors needed a good cleaning, especially in the bathroom. If youre looking for a crash pad in a great location, this is it

Good location, especially if you like Italian food. Less than 20 min walk to most tourist attractions. While AC is powerful and cools down the apartment fast, it would not hurt to clean the air filter in it.brNote that apartment is located on the 4th floor American with narrow stairway. Overall the apartment is pretty worn out shower curtain and metal rings for it, widow blinds, nightstand lamp covers, plates, iron, hair dryer. brApartment has plenty of space for 23 people but is poorly organized no tea kettle, no extra plastic garbage bags, just two decent hangers for clothes, noisy AC is located in the bedroom so we had to choose between quietness and coolness at night.brApartment has WiFi but it is quite slow for browsing let alone streaming.

Having stayed at 2 Hull St. Ct 4 in Phone number hidden by Airbnb , I knew the place was campy and basic  However, there was NO kitchen as before, and as described in the Air BnB writeup, which meant no stove or sink  The water from the bathroom sink barely dribbles out.  There was no extra roll of toilet paper, and not even a full one on the holder.  The bed was extremely noisy, and one chair at the table was wobbly to the point we didnt sit at the table at all.  The side chairs in the bedroom are broken down and uncomfortable and dirty.  The TV remote didnt work, even with new batteries.  Took a Hidden by Airbnb search to figure out how to turn the TV down, as it isnt obvious, nor intuitive.  The couch is very uncomfortable for sleeping, and there werent any washcloths with the towel supply.brbrThe location is great  Pack lightly  The stairs are narrow and steep to get to the 4th floor uneven treads and risers.

This is a great air bnb if your primary concern is location and youre fine with a quirky place. Its in a very central location and is reasonably priced. Note that its on the 4th floor in an understandably older building, so there are steep stairs, narrow hallways, etc. The bed was pretty uncomfortable and the walls were extremely thin we felt like the downstairs neighbors were in the room with us. Generally, the place could use some TLC. I had great communication from the hosts and knew exactly how to check in.

DO NOT STAY HERE unless you are an Olympic athlete.   The 4 story staircase is extremely narrow, steep, and shaky.   I am a person that does 45 minutes per day on a stairmaster and almost died trying to carry my suitcases up those stairs.  Once inside, it felt extremely unsafe.      We left after 20 minutes and had to pay for a hotel.   Jose refused to refund my money.   DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT STAY HERE.   Book elsewhere.    This was my first bad experience with AIRBNB and Ive NEVER asked for my money back from anyone.

The location of this unit is great. However, you definitely get what you pay for. The hallways in the building have dirty carpet, smells bad and is very stuffy. The unit we stayed in had holes in the walls and ceiling everywhere. There are exposed wires hanging from under the tv through a hole in the wall and from what looks like where old smoke detectors used to be on the ceiling. There are holes in the walls in the bathroom as well. This place just left us feeling uneasy and very dirty staying there so we tried to stay away from the room as long as possible during our stay in Boston.

The LOCATION of the appartment is without a doubt AMAZING. If you like pastry shops, cafs and local restaurants, youll be well served. Very quiet neighbourhood. Smooth checkin. ABOUT CLEANLINESS for us, cleanliness isnt just about dust and stains. You wont be stepping in a dirty appartment, but the place needs to be refreshed. Things hanging from the ceiling in the bathroom, mold in the shower thats been covered up, old paint, holes in walls, broken lamp shades and so on... if these kinds of details dont matter to you, youre golden. If you need hangers for a longer stay, bring some as there are 4 hangers only... Shampoo and conditioner were provided. If you plan to cook, note that youll have to do the dishes in the bathroom sink

I would not recommend this place if at all possible. The apartment is on the fourth floor of an EXTREMELY tight walk up. The stairs are narrow and rickety, the carpeting is uneven and its VERY difficult to get your bags up to the fourth floor. We found tons of large boxes and construction items outside the apartment upon our arrival. The whole building is musty and dingy. It feels unclean. The apartment itself is also dingy and dusty. The bedspread photographed is not what you will find in the bedroom. We got a dingy old blue fleece blanket. Blanket is probably overstating it.The apartment is VERY bare and I felt very uncomfortable and nervous there. You can hear everything from the floors below. I would not recommend. Keep reading reviews that will corroborate.  The location is right on the Freedom Trail and its a good central location. The air conditioning in the room did work. It has four walls and a door that locks... The bathroom is lacking as best but it functions. This was the worst AirBnb Ive rented and even though it was late when we arrived I left and went somewhere else. Its worth the extra  to go somewhere better if you can. This apartment needs some serious updating before it should be rented.

The location is second to none.  If there had just been one or two of the following items that needed attention, it would be easily overlooked, but it was an overall appearance that I expected to be better. brThe rugs in the living room and the bedroom had lint and fuzz from other guests on it. The window sills in all rooms were dirtydusty. The window shades were not clean. I wiped down around the sink when I arrived. The curtains in the bedroom had water stains. The lamp shades were stained, dirty and dented. The interior doors and door jams were very dirty. The shade in the bathroom fell off when I tried to lower them. There were numerous places that had been patched, but not repainted. The old smoke detector was hanging out of the ceiling by its wires.

This was a nice place to stay  very perfectly located near food, public transit, and tourist destinations. The host was quick to remedy any issues that we had. The one note I would make is that in addition to no stoveoven which the listing makes clear, there is no kitchen sink. Just the bathroom sink. So while there is indeed a hot plate and some potspans for cooking, the small bathroom sink made it difficult to clean dishes.brbrThe space was great and clean and we enjoyed our stay. However, the building is old this is the oldest part of the city so if you are put off by typical signs of old construction e.g. cramped bathrooms, aged grout in the bathroom tile, narrow staircases then this isnt the place for you.

The place was perfectly located, in the heart of Italian area, which is where all the historical places are.brNo street parking but a short walk away you can find a public parking but expensive.brThe Appartment is spacious for 2 people, a little dark but cosy and old in a good way. brWe didnt meet Jason but he went out of his way to answer questions quickly.brOver all nice stay

This location is amazing. We loved staying in the North End, literally across the street from the Old North Church, 10 mins from North Station on the green line, and a 30 minute walk or less to almost anywhere in the city. The apartment was very dark not much natural light and the upstairs neighbors could be heard easily, but for a place to sleep and leave our things as we explored the city, neither of those drawbacks were a big deal. Thanks

The quintessential apartment in the North End  Amazing location right next to the Old North Church  such a beautiful sight to see every morning on my way to get an espresso at the neighboring Italian Cafe.  The apartment was spotless, quiet, safe, and cozy.  The bed was so comfortable and had really nice linens on it.  The hosts went above and beyond in their communication and made me feel very welcome.  I cant wait to go back to Boston and stay here again

We had a great stay for two nights. The apartment was clean and cosy, and the location is ideal for exploring the city. Our host was easy to reach, and let us store our bags in the apartment before our official checkin time and again after our checkout time, which really helped us.  Thanks for the great accomodations, Jose

This place was PERFECT We even had a third unexpected guest at the last minute and they accommodated our every need  Location is snuggled into the heart of the north end, where EVERYTHING is such a close, scenic walk. There is a little mart within a 2 minute walk of the apartment if you want grocery or toiletry items etc., and Hanover the main strip is literally less than a block awayso all the restaurants and coffee shops are super close. There is even a little mercato where locals have salamis and cheeses that is a musttry right down the street. We came to city to visit a couple nights, planning only to sleep at our Airbnb location, but its a charming apartment if you decide to take a load off after a day of exploringas we did, one of the nights after dinner We will be back If not to this specific apartment, than at least one also hosted by Jose and Jasoneverything was so great and well thought out

My girlfriend and I went to Boston for NYE 2016 and stayed at Joses place.  It was very easy to find and was exactly as described.  It is located immediately across from The Old North Church and is a very short walk from restaurants and nightlife.  Highly recommended for a weekend getaway

Great experience overall. The apartment is in a perfect North End location close to amazing restaurants and Freedom Trail but in a quiet alley. Clean and convenient.

Highly recommended, would stay here again.

The location just cant be beat. Its so super safe and JoseJason let us to drop off our bags early before check in  also let us leave them after check out. They were also very responsive by air bnb message. We are not used to city apartment life and the whole set up was strange to me at first. I was confused as to how to get in. They walked me through it and we got in wo issues. We didnt use the kitchenette much but the fridge was very convenient and there is even silverware, plates, and a coffee and espresso maker. The only negative was that Im pretty sure there was a herd of nocturnal baby elephants staying above us. Wouldnt have been so bad but they sounded like they got home at 12 and2 am and got up at 430am.

What a perfect location  right in the heart of the North End and less than 50 yards from the Old North Church It was clean, comfortable, and unique.  I appreciated the good WI FI.  You can hear neighbors walking sometimes, so light sleepers might bring soft earplugs.  But its an old building, right where we wanted to be, and we both thought it was a great experience.

Located in front of the Old North Church, a stop of the Freedom Trail.   The place is located in little Italy with many great restaurants nearby.  If you plan to eat at one of the restaurants, put your name down on the list early or you will have to wait 12 hours to be seated.  The studio entrance is tucked away down a little ally.  It is quiet and private.   I plan to be in Boston next year for the same conference.  Ill probably stay here again.

The ease and convenience of this apartment and the checkincheckout process was great. The location is unbeatable. Many interesting sights and wonderful restaurants nearby, easy public transit access, not too far from the airport. brbrThe apartment is noisy, which is no fault of the host, and to be expected in a cityold building. However, the noise from upstairs occupants is a major consideration for a light sleeper. There is virtually no sound barrier. brbrAlso, the bed is super high. No big deal, unless youre very pregnantshort as I am andor at all physically impaired. brbrWe could tell some cleaning had been done prior to our arrival, because products were left out, but it seemed unfinished. There were a few little things that would have made our stay more comfortable I.e. a bath mat, enough towels,  fresh bed linens. brbrOverall, it was OK, and mostly worth it for the convenience.

The apartment is in a good location. Unfortunately, the noise you can hear at every time of the day is just not worth it. You constantly hear steps and conversations upstairs, the sounds of some electrodomestics and several sounds of the building even with ear plugs. The sofa is really uncomfortable, the mattres needs to be changed asap, the TV has a lamp yes, a lamp in front of it so you only have partial view of the tv, among other small details as not enough towels. I wont recommend this airbnb at all. Location is everything, until is not.

The location of this lovely little apartment is perfect.

The place is old but mostly well kept minus a few maintenance issues with the bathroom door and ceiling fan.

While the location was wonderful the place was overall unkept and unfinished.  The walls had heavy spackle in each room, everywhere, and yet was not sanded or painted. The bathroom door was extremely difficult to open and close as it had expanded quite a bit due to moisture.  The blinds were broken and dirty.  There were missing tiles in the bathroom.  The furniture was dusty, a fire alarm was removed and updated but the old hole was not covered.  With some maintenance  this could be a nice apartment but it was not up to the same level of cleanliness and Maintenance of any Airbnb I have previously stayed in.  Ive never had anything but wonderful experiences with Airbnb, this apartment is not up to par with what I have come to expect from Airbnb.  When I brought up these concerns with the hosts they said that the home was historic.  However these issues have nothing to do with age.  The apartment has been neglected for some time and requires some maintenance.

This is the Worst Airbnb I have ever experienced in the entire USA.   The shower and tub were filthy and the walls were paper thin.  It sounded like the people upstairs would come crashing down through the ceiling.   I reserved this place for 3 nights and could only stand it for a couple of hours until I found a new place to stay.   Unfortunately, the people that own it did not seem to care when I messaed them about these issues. They got their money regardless.  brI am not sure how this place has good reviews at all.  Do not stay here if you care about basic cleanliness and a place where youdont feel like your neighbors are in your same room.  brShould be zero stars but that was not an option.
facilities negative
The space is very nice and the location is great but the people upstairs were up at all hours walking back and forth. We could hear everything and we couldnt sleep. Jason responded to my complaint and he says they are renovating the apartment soon and that they will get some carpets for the apartment above. That should solve the problem.  Also, note there are no table and chairs. It didnt bother us because we ate out but it wasnt clear from the description

The place was clean, cool, and convenient.brbrAlso, Chris and Kelly were super nice and waited to greet us late Friday despite the fact we were later than expected due to a delayed flight.

Just spent 4 nights with my husband and 23 yr old son.  The apartment was exactly as advertised.  It was spotless Nice view of the USS Constitution and Navy Shipyard.  Great location for all the sites.  Was concerned about the noise level because it faces a main street however, was pleasantly surprised how quiet it was at night.  By 7AM the traffic did pick up, but still not a major issue.brPlenty of linens and towels and the kitchen was well stocked with all the necessities should we have wanted to cook full meals.  We did use the kitchen for breakfast and to reheat leftovers from the restaurants we frequented.  brJust a word of caution, the stairwell is tight and narrow.  We had one large suitcase which was a little cumbersome to navigate in the stairwell.  We expected this as weve stayed in similar apartments elsewhere therefore, it was not an issue for us, but might be for someone else.brLoved the fact we could get into the apartment as early as 12 noon which gave us an extra half day to explore Boston.  Our flight landed at 1130.  By the time we got a cab and got to the apartment it was 1200 and Angela Maureens assistant was already there waiting for us.brOverall we had a great experience and will definitely stay here again next time were in Boston.

A wonderful place to stay during two nights in Boston with my husband and a friend.

FANTASTIC  This apartment could not have been in a better location.  I traveled to Boston with my two teenage sons and we were lucky enough to stay in Maureens rental.  This quaint apartment was located right in the North End  thats the middle of everything in my opinion.  A harbor view, great restaurants, the Freedom Trail, etc...all within walking distance.  The apartment itself was clean and felt spacious for all three of us.  Ralph met us with the keys upon our arrival and was the sweetest man ever  Thank you for giving us a safe and comfortable place to lay our heads after some long days of sight seeing.  The staircase to the unit was a bit tight and steep, but we just considered it part of our exercise each day.  Thank you for a GREAT stay

Recently stayed at Angelas North End aparment over the 4th of July holiday.  Couldnt have been a better experience.  The location is perfect.  You are within footsteps of all the great Italian restaurants.  You are within walking distance of most anything else you want to see in Boston.  As with the rest of Boston parking is at a premium, but there are 2 parking lots one garage and one open lot that can be used and are very close.  The view from the aprtment is great as well.  We experienced 90 heat while there and the AC in the apartment worked flawlessly.  The unit is updated and well appointed.  Overall a great place to stay if you are visting Boston.

We enjoyed our stay at this cozy apt.  It now has air conditioning and was very comfortable on the hot  humid Boston days.  The location is a short walk from the T, but very doable.  We felt very safe at this location and throughout the city.  We stayed there with our 5 year old son.  We used the fold out bed as the full bed isnt large enough for the 3 of us.  Both were comfortable.   I wouldnt recommend more than 3 people.  Ralph was waiting for us when we arrived, making the check in process very simple.  The Waterfront Cafe just down the block is excellent, as are all of the restaurants we tried in the North End and throughout Boston.  Parking is tricky and expensive  we returned our rental car and got the weeklong pass for the T.  The best way to drop off luggage before returning the car is to park temporarily on Foster St which is right at the entrance to the apt.  We took a cab back to the airport for about 15.  Bottom line  would stay here again  great value

This was our first AirBnB experience so we did not know what to expect. Ralph came promptly when we arrived and the space was great. The view of the USS Constitution and the location in North End really made it a wonderful stay. The stairs were narrow, but manageable. Other reviews had mentioned no soap, toaster, or coffee pot, but all of these were there. I had expected the neighborhood to be a little noisy, but it was quiet even on the weekend nights. We were not sure if the sheets were clean, but there was another set in the cabinets and we changed them out just in case. We definitely recommend this place.

Our stay at Paolos appartment was great Location is excellent, walking distance from  a lot of restaurants, parts of the centre of Boston and the subway. Paolo informed me very well about the parking options in the neighbourhood. Ralph, who is taking care of the visitors if Paolo is not around, was very easy to contact. The appartment was clean, had everything you need and has a terrific view We, me and my two sons of 15 and 17, love Boston and when we return we surely will book this appartment again

The apartment and the neighborhood is really nice. The North End is kind of like a little Italy with a lot of good restaurants, bakerys and gelato places. We loved it. The apartment is clean and close to downtown and you could walk almost everywhere.

Great location,with a lovely view. Very easy to find and all went well with access. Very well equipped kitchen, comfy bed and good shower. We loved the veiw of the boats coming and going particularly at sunset. The proximity to little Italy was perfect for us. The narrow streets,historic buildings and range of places to eat is just FAB. We walked the town, using the subway just once. We would highly recomend this accommodation to anyone. Do note there is a fairly narrow spiral stair case and you are on the second level. Certainly not an issue  for us but may be a problem if you have very large heavy luggage or  are not fairly able.

the apartment was ready when promised and the representative was polite and informative.

Wow  What a great place.  We were very impressed.  The apartment had great views, large kitchen, and a good sized bathroom, and very clean.  Lots of windows that let all of the sunlight in.  Plenty of towels and extra sheets too.  Overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend Paolos place to others and stay there again myself.  A couple of points that others have mentioned, the stairs to the apartment are spiraled and steep, which wasnt a problem for us.  Also since it faces Commercial St. there is street noise.  Again, not a problem for us at all.  Thanks Paolo and Ralph

This place is everything you need to make a great weekend in Boston. It is clean, air conditioned and pretty new.

Great location for those happy to walk and which will improve even further when the upgrading of Commercial Street is finished shortly we were unfortunate to be staying when the road work team were working directly outside.  North End is vibrant with a fantastic array of eating places primarily Italian and the apartment is very close to the action, yet far enough away to remain quiet, although, inevitably Commercial Rd is quite busy. Just off the Freedom Trail and with a neat view of the Bunker Hill monument directly from the apartment window.brHandy 7eleven closeby.

Had a nice time staying here. Proximity to all the amazing food and pastry shops in Little Italy was perfect.

Check in was a breeze, and we really appreciated the tips on things to see and do in the area. We would definitely stay again when traveling to Boston

Great window view is exactly as shown, looking out at the USS constitution across the mouth of the Charles river. Easy walk to Old North Church, and thus the Freedom trail, which extends from Bunker Hill to Boston Common Garden. brbrThe Taxiride from airport is about 10 minutes and 20. Location is about 1015 minute walk to various train Tstops. It is 10minute 0.5 mile walk to TD Boston Garden sports arena. 10min walk to Aquarium, downtown, Faneuil Hall, or Haymarket. Recommend good walking shoes in Boston, since it is a walkable and compact town for sightseeing.brbrThere is a 7eleven convenience store a block away, open 247. The minor downside, is there are no bigbox grocery stores in downtown Boston. You will NOT however starve with so many great restaurants in nearby Little Italy most open until 11 pm, and we chose to order in Italian language too, though English is fine too. brbrThis waterfront studio has a comfortable queen bed and a queen sofa bed, kitchen, and toilet with shower no bathtub. It was nice to find coffeemaker, tea, honey, and toaster available. The entry is on second floor of winding staircase, so again, bring comfortable shoes for walking in Boston. We would be glad to stay here again in the future.

This is a small efficiency apartment, a good size for just my husband and myself. Communication was excellent with both Paolo, the owner, and Ralph, who met us on arrival and was very responsive when needed. The apartment, very clean and tidy, is a second floor walk up in an older building.  We are in pretty good condition physically but anyone with mobility issues should be aware that the stairs might present a challenge. The kitchen appliances seem to be new, the furnishings elsewhere are basic.  The bed was quite comfortable. brbrBy far the best part of staying here is the location  We used to live in the area so we know that the North End is Bostons liveliest neighborhood with lots of character. Walk everywhere  The best restaurants are literally a couple minutes away, as are major tourist attractions.  We left our car in a lot 2 blocks down the street which cost about 125 for 4 nights. brbrThank you, Paolo  We had a wonderful time in Boston

Jennifer was a wonderful host from the moment she responded so quickly to my queries. We stayed over only one night, but because of missing our connection in D.C.we live in New Orleanswe didnt arrive in Boston until late, very late. Nonetheless, she waited for my wife and me to arrive until after 115 AM. The room was as we expected, which is to say all that we wanted. We slept well the bed was comfortable. My wife is also interested in becoming part of Airbnb, and Jennifer was helpful in her advice and responding to our questions. Because we arrived so late at night, we only saw the neighborhood as we left in the morning. It looked safe and possessed character.

I agree with some other reviews, they can really do better with the place. brThe location is spectacular, all the major attractions in the old town can be easily reached on foot. The flat is actually a studio, no door between the bedroom and sitting room, just a frame, but  is roomy for two or three person. brThe equipment and service could use some improvements though. I booked the place for three, but it was clearly setup for just two. No extra bedding available in the room. I slept on the sofa with only a bath towel for the first night, because wed been arrived very late. They brought in the third set of bedding the next day when they received my complaint. Plus the sofa is really just a sofa, not a sofa bed. The cushions placed on the sofa cannot be moved, which makes little room for sleeping in, even with me being on a smaller size, less than 160cm45kg, I dont feel comfortable.brThe key box really takes some time for figuring out, if you never saw and used one. Ill say a picture of the box can be helped a lot. It took me a while for realizing those are the key box I was looking for. brThey have a full kitchen but little kitchenware, kind of a waste.brOne more thing, the flat is on the third floor with narrow stairs, big luggage can be a challenging.brOverall, we still enjoyed our stay, the location certainly overruled its downsides Website hidden by Airbnb

I sort of had a lovehate relationship with this place.  Ill start with the great things about this place.  Its a spacious place with a bedroom, living room, bathroom and small kitchen.  The bed was comfy but I needed better pillows. just my preference  The location is AMAZING  Right outside is the Old North Church and there are a lot of restaurants and sights within walking distance. Youre right on the Freedom Trail.  Jose was always easily accessible and returned my queries within minutes.  So, the things that we werent happy about...we could hear EVERYTHING from the people upstairs and downstairs.  We could hear the people upstairs snoring  Then they decide to wake up at 4am and walk around seriously for three hours straight.  We didnt get a good nights sleep the whole time we were there.  Then we left one morning to get breakfast and were going to come back to rest a little and two guys were there to fix the shower.  So we leave and go sightseeing and come back 5 12 hours later.  We walk in and theres a shower door in the living room, a radio blasting and the salt and pepper were out.  We sat waiting to see what was going on and one of the workers comes back and says he had used the kitchen to heat up his food and ate there while we were gone.  So we had to wait for him to finish fixing the shower then FINALLY got to relax.  Then he said not to use the shower until later in the evening.  The place is beautiful with exposed brick and chimney, but the floor heaters were away from the wall a little and there was paint peeling in places and there seemed to be water damage to the floorboards in the bathroom.  Its an old place so the floors were very creaky and loud.  The rooms could use some new paint and the whole place could use a little bit more love.

I really enjoyed my stay in Bostons North End. The bedroom is larger then it appears in the photos and the apartment is generally in good condition. We were only in the apartment really to sleep, so the lack of TV and Kitchen space were no problem at all. If youre in the North End, you need to be getting out anyway. brbrThe walls are thin as others mentioned, and this works both ways, you will hear everyone else in the building and they will also hear you.brbrWhen we initially arrived a friend was breaking apart a bag of ice in the bathtub thinking hed avoid a mess, but this instead made an echoing noise through the building and we were checked in on ... I had flash backs to living in college dorms and having an RA suddenly appear in my room ...  but the host was very polite and just wanted to make sure we werent there to party.brbrOverall a nice place to stay and a nice weekend.

Very nice flat in the North End of Boston. On the plus side it is a great location. The bed was very comfortable. The shower was very good. Retrieving the keys and getting into the flat was quite easy. The cost for what you are getting was quite fair. On the negative side, you can hear all conversations from the people above you like they are right next to you. The kitchen is less than even basically equipped. There is no can opener, the 2 pots are not really usable, you get the idea. It would be nice if there was one surface you could sit at at table height so you were not hunched over a coffee table to eat. The night table lamps are a little dim to read by. I think the noise factor would prevent me from renting this again as it would be hit or miss who else is staying in the building.

Great comfortable place to stay  1 bedroom with access from the common area or directly from the hallway.  Air mattresses or a comfortable couch to sleep on if you dont want to share the bed.  Floors were pretty creaky, but that was about the only concern

This place is a hidden gem Just off the beaten path in the North End. Literally minutes to the best restaurants in the city and Im not a big fan of walking The bed is comfy and the apartment is clean. It is old but Id like to call that charm. Id definitely stay again The host was wonderful to work Very very accommodating.

My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary and baby moon. It was a great spot in the BEST location The North End was our favourite area of the whole city so we were thrilled that we were staying there.

Jose was kind and professional and provided all the information we needed before we got there.

This is literally right in the heart of it all Right in the middle of the freedom trail walk, which is a great activity to do while in Boston. Great food is all around. The space is neat, clean and comfortable. Be aware that if you plan on changing check out times to later in the day that they have a cleaning service at 11am. They accidentally threw out our food that we were bringing back to our family as a gift however they did retrieve it and bring it back to us before we left.  Overall a great experience and I would stay there again.

We were also able to arrange for a parking pass from Jose for a small additional fee which was great.

We love the neighborhood and the apartment was is an excellent location with public parking just up the street.  We were able to walk the North End totally.   The apartment was clean but not terribly well appointed with details that could be easily fixed.  There was no blanket for the third person, just a sleeping bag.  The 2 air mattresses were leaking, one had obviously been pushed up against the heating unit and had many holes, deflated instantly, needs to be removed.  The other had  a slow leak and could not be used over night.  The layflat couch was a joke  back and seat different heights, and if you lay on the back it tipped you onto the floor. Ha Ha.  funny but a good sleep.   There were 3 guests scheduled and only 2 plates, inadequate glasses and silverware.   The hosts had asked us to be quiet, but the upstairs neighbors partied loudly until 200 am as if they were in our rooms.  It was happy noise and with our cell phone appts. we got to sleep.

GREAT location surrounded by Italian restaurants and small shops, boutiques. Very clean apartment and a good size. We had one person in the bed and one person on the couch, and it worked out great with enough privacy between the rooms, without being shut off from each other. We had a small issue with finding towels and sheets for the third guest at the beginning, but I contacted Jose and he sent over what we needed within an hour.

This was so central, we were walking distance from everything we wanted to do Jose was very responsive with everything.

We had a great time in Boston Jasons place was perfect for our short trip.  The North End was a great location, so many great restaurants and history.

This apartment is in a great location in the North End.  Literally, it is steps away form the Old North Church.  The apartment is small but has a nice size bedroom and bathroom.  It has a kitchen but there is no  counter space so any cooking would be difficult.  Luckily, there are so many restaurants and bakeries in the area it is not an issue.  You do climb two flights of stairs to get to the apartment so if that is an issue be aware.  The entry to the building is down a narrow alley way but it was well lit at night and it seems like a very safe neighborhood.

Unit was just as described. Having never been to Boston, I was surprised at how tight the North End of Boston feels. Roads to get to the unit, the alley way, and even the unit felt very small. Definitely had a lot of charm, but could feel a little claustrophobic at times. That being said, walking to various places was a breeze. Very close to everything. If you can get past the extremely cramped area of the North End, this is a good place to stay. Something to be aware of, maybe I missed it in the description, but the unit is located INSIDE of door 2. Can be a little confusing and frustrating when trying to locate the unit with all your luggage on a hot afternoon. Also, its on the third floor and the stairs are VERY tight and steep. Be cautious on how much luggage you have. The bed was very comfortable and the ac unit worked great

Also the fireplace doesnt work which I was initially excited for since it was 10 outside and hoped to come in and make a roaring fire.  If you like to walk around and check out the city i would definitely recommend, its perfect but if youre trying to escape to a quiet place, and hang at the apartment, it can be quite loud because the walls are thin.

The location was great. It was within walking distance of a lot of restaurants and bars. Unfortunately, our check in was not a good experience. When we arrived within our checkin time and at least an hour after the earliest time we could check in, the key to our unit was not there. I called Jose and he told me that the previous tenants left their luggage there and would be back in 1520 minutes. We proceeded to wait. I got a text from Jose indicating the basement unit was ready for tenants, and we could either take that unit or wait for the other tenants to bring back the key and clear out. We opted for the basement unit. Unfortunately, there was no toilet paper in the unit and the bathroom sink was not working. It was decent for an inexpensive night in Boston and was very conveniently located. If not for our unpleasant check in experience and lack of basic amenities, I would have rated higher.

You wont get a more perfect location  right across from the Old North Church on the Freedom Trail.

However, the building as expected in that part of town, is very old, and the upstairs neighbors  people in the stairwell sound like theyre almost in the same room.

The location is amazing, I LOVED the neighborhood. The apartment itself it very basic and cozy, amenities like soap, shampoo, towels, etc. were provided. There is little to no outside street noise, however, within the building its basically like there are no walls. Anyone coming up the stairs sounds like they are coming right through the bedroom and you can here every step and noise in the apartment above. The gentleman in the apartment above me had a conference call at 7 am and it sounded like he was in bed with me, I heard every word and the people on speakerphone. I live in a prewar building in a major metropolitan area so Im used to apartment noises, this was worse. So essentially if youre a light sleeper, come prepared.

This place is exactly as the other reviewers have described and we had a very lovely time staying at Joses place. The location is PRIME. Right on the freedom trail, down the street from a 247 bakery that was a stop nearly every night on our trip.

I was very pleased with how safe everything felt. Jose was quick to respond to me and check inout was a breeze. Only real downsides to us were just a dated bathroom in need of some TLC and a mattress that was a little too firm and worn down.

The location was great, walking distance to everything you could want. We did have a slight problem with the sheets in the bedroom being stained and having a few hairs on them. The shower would also not drain. The host was very responsive, however, and immediately sent someone over with clean sheets when we informed him. The sheets that were delivered smelled very badly of cigarette smoke though I assume the deliverer was smoking in his car so we just ended up sleeping on the stained sheets anyway.

There was no ice in the freezer, no kitchen supplies coffee, filters, etc and there was one towel per person provided even though our stay was for more than one day.   This was a bare bones type place.  However, the location was outstanding.  Literally less than a block from the Old North Church and right on the Freedom Trail.

Ive stayed at plenty of Airbnbs and this is my first bad experience. I am surprised this place has such great reviews. Sure, the location is great, but the actual apartment was of very poor quality. I completely understand that the building is very old be prepared to hear every footstep from the floor above you and for every step you take to be extremely creaky, but I just couldnt get past how bad the rest of the place is. It was as if no effort was made to maintain the apartment. Dingy, dirty shower, duct tape on tub, an extremely uncomfortable creaky bed pairs well with the creaky floors, no amenities. Nothing really felt clean...brbrI hate leaving a bad review but I was very upset with the quality. Just steps away is a ton of history, the desirable North End area, and tons of restaurants.... but how sad it is that such a historic and expensive building is so poorly maintained.brbr If I could go back and give myself a piece of advice before booking dont do it.

The location cant be beaten. This is definitely a hidden gem based on location. The BnB is dated, but it is a historic building. It is small, yet cozy. But, lets be honest you arent here to stay in the BnB, there are just so many things to do in this area. Be prepared to walk quite a bit, as there is no close by parking its a couple of blocks away. Overall, well worth your time and choosing this location if this is your first time coming to Boston

This place is in a fantastic location in the heart of the North End. Super easy walking distance from several historic landmarks and excellent restaurants. This neighborhood has coffee shops, pastry shops, elegant dining and small neighborhood markets on almost every block. brbrMost importantly, youre equidistant from two T stops less than a 10minute walk away, which ultimately makes ALL of Boston very accessible without having a vehicle of your own. brbrThe bathroom is decent and the bedroom is generous, considering the location and comparable units in the area. It has a small kitchen and a comfy couch for lounging, but if youre in this area hopefully youll spend most of your time out and about, so the small size of the kitchen shouldnt bother you. brbrIts about 100 feet from Old North Church. Even though its in a very popular touristy area, it feels very private and its quiet in the apartment thanks to its location on the third floor at the end of an alleyway.

The location of this place was PERFECT. Steps literally from the Old North Church, and nestled down a little footpath, it felt like Italy. Aside from that  its quaint, VERY creaky, and badly needs some updates. Wed consider staying again, but only for longer stays where the high cleaning fee would not impact a single daily rate as much. I wouldnt plan to use the kitchen or spend much time here  it was a place to crash, not a place to vacation. The shower tiles are cracking and dirty, there is duct tape on the bathroom wall, and kitchen tiles are falling off. The bed was not comfortable. The IDEA of this place was great, but we found it underwhelming we also found a fake fingernail in the bedroom. Ew. The emails from the host before we even came made us feel like we were a burden vs welcome guests. SO. MANY. RULES. Book it, just keep your expectations aligned.

The floorboards need serious update tho. The walls are extremely thin and the mattress isnt comfortable. This place is perfect for short stays. They offered clean towels, body wash and shampoo. Didnt cook but they had all basic tools in the kitchen

I stayed at Roberts house while attending conference at Westin Copley hotel. brThe location is amazing.

It was a bit dusty from all the books in the house they are EVERYWHERE, which I didnt mind. brbrThe only substantial negative for me was that the internet, otherwise fast and reliable, is going out when someone is talking on the phone. If your work relies on uninterrupted access, make sure to warn Robert. brbrIn my opinion, room is best suited for one guest, I had a good time there alone, although a young couple might find it also pretty attractive and convenient. brbrOverall, good value for the money.

I was quite disappointed in my stay at Roberts home home. My bedroom had a comfy bed, but there were no drawers to put my clothes in both closets were stuffed with boxes and paper. There were 10 of space but no hangers to hang clothing on. I did get hangers when I requested them from his assistant. The TV was 15 square and the remote did not work. There were no locks on any of the five guest bedrooms and only one working smoke detector that I could find on the four floors of the home. No one could enter the front door because it was packed with stuff so everyone had to enter from the little door under the stairs. I was most dismayed with the kitchen which was filthy unusable, and all surfaces were covered with stuff including the stove. I asked for some Kleenex for my room and I was given a roll of toilet paper. Someone tried to enter my room in the middle of the night and I yelled  they left. I shared the bathroom with two other people    As mentioned in the other reviews, the house and hall walls were filled with stacks of books. After two nights I just couldnt stay there anymore and abandoned my third night reservation. I called and emailed Robert to get him to try to rent my third night but I never heard back from him.

The following isnt said in mean spirit  I think staying at your grandparents house is a good frame of reference.  A little dusty, little musty, quirks of an old house I never managed to get warm water out of the faucet, but good people.  I would stay again but might look somewhere else first.

Had a great experience with Joan  emails were responded to promptly with detailed and informative information.  The property was as described and so much better  it felt like a home away from home and after traveling around USA for so long it was great to have somewhere to call home for a while.  We were able to truly relax in this property.  Joans property is a gorgeous home in East Boston  a very easy commute to the city.  We loved living away from the city so we could meet the locals which gave us a great perspective of Boston.  A wonderful experience all round

Joan is great to work with, she responded to email fast and the listing is very accurate. The location is within walking distance to the T line which made it very handy to get into the city and also right by a 711 for morning coffee. Joan was really nice to allow us to leave our luggage past check out time so we could enjoy Boston before our evening flight. There was an abundance of blankets, toiletrys for use and the concierge upstairs tennant even offered beer from the fridge. She had a great amount of brochures for the city and I even borrowed the state atlas when we drove to Cape Cod. If you want to order in dinner theres a Peruvian place that makes a great roasted chicken. If it was warmer out I would have had breakfast on the from porch.

Our family of three, with son of 13, stayed for two weeks in the apartment in the summer of 2014. It felt like home away from home. All you need is available in the apartment for a short, or longer stay as we had. The apartment is as described with all amenities in excellent condition and has free parking on the street with always space when we were there. Within a short walk you are at a nice and quiet beach or at the metro to get into Boston, where there is plenty to do. In the area itself there are plenty of places to eat of have food delivered from too. brbrJoan and Charlotte are wonderful host, always there to answer questions or give advise or help.

I found communications with Joan were a little short on detail and and a little cursory and short.brWe arrived at the house and found it difficult to get our cases up the steep front stairs of differing heights. brFront access is very easy despite the somewhat puzzling overemphasis on how to use the locking system on the houses Airbnb site and again in instructions.brThe final instructions were very skimpy and when we got in the door I needed to check the Airbnb site for clarity on which parts of the house were for our access.brDespite the description that the property is independent, on entry to the house there are stairs to an upstairs area.  brThe house was dark and dingy with low ceilings and a strange smell.  Certainly not the relatively bright space that the photos portray.brWe dropped off our cases despite growing misgivings about the house and left to drop off the rental car at the airport.brWhile we were away we discussed our experience of the house and agreed we should not stay there.  We got a cab, collected our things from Joans space and checked into a hotel.brSadly Joans reaction to a very polite advice of our decision was to be condescending.  A gracious reaction would have been more appropriate, considering Joan was still receiving all the payment due to our late cancellation.  brAwfully glad we didnt staybr

My friend and I found Joans home very welcoming and comfortable. Its an older home with lots of character and charm. Funky, in a good way The kitchen is well equipped, the beds comfy, and the apartment is roomy. It was kept very clean and there were plenty of towels.  Unfortunately we were only there for 2 nights this time and unable to explore the neighborhood much. Its a good walk to the subway, which we took easily around Boston. We also drove one day to Harvard and the North End which was not difficult, but parking is expensive. I would recommend Joans apartment.

Joan and Charlotte rescued us from a bad experience with another property. Joans responsiveness and helpfulness was such a relief and meant that were quickly able to move from where we were. An enormous thank you for that, as it really saved our holiday The difference in welcome we then received was enormous. Charlotte took us to the supermarket and we felt that we had finally arrived in Boston. The accommodation itself suited us perfectly parents with a 15 year old daughter. There is lots of space and everything you need, in a very peaceful spot. The walk to the T is incredibly simple and quick, so we were out an about in no time.

We enjoyed staying in Chris and Kristinas studio apartment in Jamaica Plain. We were there to visit our son and his fiance who live about three blocks from the studio, so it was the most convenient location possible. The studio was very comfortable, with a large bedroom with a very comfortable queen sized bed, space to hang clothes and a TVDVD player, a breakfast alcove, a fullsize kitchen and a nice big bathroom with a terrific shower, was very comfortable. It was spotlessly clean and decorated with original artwork.  It is very cozy and had a private entrance at the rear of the hosts house so that we could come and go as we pleased without disturbing them. Kristina was available by text or phone to take care of a couple of questions and requests. She delivered a hair dryer and an extra pillow within minutes after we asked for them. brJust a couple of blocks down the road is the shopping area of Jamaica Plain which has all the usual chain stores as well as lots of charming or quirky local businesses.brSuch a nice change from hotels...and a charming quiet neighborhood easily accessible to the rest of Boston by MBTA  the T or by car. br

The location was great, close to the T and to buses that went straight into the city.  The studio was just as pictured in their profile, clean and bright.  It was a great experience

The hosts were not home when we arrived, but they left a key and directions to the room which had its own entrance and was on the side of the house.  The house was on a street with old Victorian houses and duplexes.  The room was on a very quiet side street.  It was  very pleasant not to have traffic going back and forth.br     The bedroom had a queen size bed, was attractively decorated,  and had a TVDVD, ample closet and drawer space.  The room also had a selection of DVDs and books.  There was an efficiency kitchen with dishes, flatware, microwave, stove, and coffee maker.  There was also a small dining area with a small table and 2 chairs.  We didnt use the kitchen because we were with family from morning until evening each day.  So I didnt look inside the cabinets or refrigerator.br      The bathroom had a good shower, shampoo and conditioner, hair dryer, and several shelves by the sink for toiletries.  There were towels of various sizes and several towel racks.  br      This room was very comfortable, cozy and quiet.  My impression was that the hosts really thought about amenities that would be appreciated by travelers.

The studio was a great space and a great starting point from which to explore JP and Boston It was compact, but the size was perfect for the two of us. The studio is very comfortable, and theres a full kitchen that we didnt take advantage of, but it would be great for someone staying a little more long term. Very close to the T station, Jamaica Pond, and a good variety of cafes, restaurants, and bars. We also had a rental car, and there is ample free street parking, which was really nice. Chris and Kristina were wonderful, too  we had an issue with the space heater and they were very quick and responsive. We would definitely recommend the studio to anyone traveling to Boston or Jamaica Plain.

This was our first experience using airbnb and we will certainly continue to do so if all experiences are as good as this one From the first email, welcoming us to her home, through the text messages during our stay, Kristina was warm and welcoming and personable. Unfortunately, our schedules didnt align, and we never met in person. We found a key and map waiting for us, and entered the adorable studio through a private entrance on the side of their home. Everything was there, as advertised  plenty of space for two, a large and well equipped bathroom, comfortable bed and more than adequate kitchen space. We would just recommend a step stool in the kitchen  we are short and the shelves with cups and plates were difficult to reach brThe neighborhood was quiet. We felt perfectly safe walking late at night between our studio and our sons home just a few blocks away. This was the most appealing reason for staying at this location. Now that weve been there, we will certainly return. Thank you, Kristina

We rented Litas Victorian condo for the weekend as an outoftown group ages 1979 attending a family reunion. It is a charming place and it worked well for us. The rooms and bathrooms were a bit smaller than expected, but very workable. Beds are comfortable with nice linens. Lita, who lives in the building, was quick to supply extra towels, sheets, and blankets, and all our interactions were extremely pleasant. There are nice little inglenooks for private conversations and catching up on work. WiFi access is free but limited to the sunroom area. br    The kitchen is clean and wellequipped, with a round oak table seating 6. One of the bathrooms is inside a bedroom but easily accessible to all during the day. br     We were able to park in the driveway which is helpful in a busy neighborhood near a hospital complex. There is a Whole Foods two blocks away and other services and restaurants within walking distance. Lita provided coffee and tea, music CDs, and touristtransit info.br    The stair lift was very welcome for an older member of our group, as there is a steep interior flight of stairs from the front door to the secondfloor flat there are about 8 steps to the front door as well. There is a door buzzer system with a security feature allowing someone upstairs in the flat to see who is at the front door. In all, a very nice homeawayfromhome.

Our family of four, 2 adults, 2 children ages 12 and 14, enjoyed our stay at this beautiful condo.  Lita met us upon arrival, showed us around and provided helpful tips.  She told us not to hesitate to call her if we needed anything, showing great hospitality.  br     The condo is the entire 2nd floor of the building.  There are tenants on the first floor and Lita is on the 3rd floor so she is close by if needed.  Laundry facilities are in the basement.  The condo was very clean and cozy and the location is ideal for exploring Boston.   The T stop, the main street of Jamaica Plain with many shops and restaurants and Jamaica Pond are a short walk away.    br   Although the condo has 4 bedrooms it is compact.

We just returned after a nine day stay at Litas property. It was perfect for our purposes a beautiful and comfortable home, with everything we could possibly need provided. It was centrally located, in a lovely neighbourhood which we really enjoyed exploring. Whole Foods was very close by and a number of interesting restaurants were near by as well. It was accessible to transit, right on the bus line or just a short walk to the T, so easy to get to downtown Boston and other areas of the city. The only downsides were that the house is at a major intersection so its quite noisy, and the room heating was a bit tricky to sort out. But we absolutely enjoyed the house  theres lots of room in each of the bedrooms and the main living areas were all beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Its a wonderful place to make your home base in Boston.

Lita was very nice when we arrived.  The condo was located in a great neighborhood with easy access to the bus and subway.  CVS was right around the corner which was great when I needed an ankle brace ouch and 711 right across the road was perfect  as well.  The restaurant down the road RobinWood Cafe was excellent.  The condo was perfect for our large group.  Plenty of space for all of us to take a break when needed. The kitchen was well stocked. Plenty of towels for all the guests. The study was great when I needed to do some work and get privacy from the rest of the group.  Overall, good stay and would recommend to others. One note is that there are tenants downstairs so if you have a loud group or young children, be aware of the quiet hour starting at 11 pm.

Breakfast, coffee, etc are not providedwhich is fine given the price and the fact that lovely coffee shops are only about twothree quick blocks away.brbrThis place is a real treasure to find in Boston.

We are puzzled by the many positive reviews for this listing.  brbrSteves communication from time of booking to our arrival was quite good.  Our space was not ready for the designated checkin time, but that happens and Steve did allow us to leave our luggage.  We did not meet Steve or anyone who may manage the home during our stay.brbrUnfortunately, the room we had access to was NOT represented accurately at all.  The bedroom was very small with no space or provisions to put luggage or hang anything.  It is not represented in any of the photos you will see in his listing. Cleanliness was questionable.  Sheets were provided, but I was perplexed why the only blanket in the room was left in a bag on the floor.  The bathroom, shared with other guests,  has a long time build up of filth.  We did not use the shower and were careful when using the toilet. brbrThere are shared kitchen facilities that we did not use.  During our very quick 2 night stay there was consistently a lot of food left on the counters and packed into the fridge.  Im guessing that which belonged to other guests. brbrIf these are not priorities that concern you as a guest, thats great.  If location is important, Ill add that it is easy walking distance to the Tline that takes you anywhere in Boston that you need to go.   As far as safety is concerned Id recommend that you read other online posts and go with your gut instinct.  As with many large urban areas, strength in numbers especially when walking at night.brbrJanis  Pat

Sams apartment in Beacon Hill was the perfect stay for my mom and I during our girls weekend to Boston.

Had a great time staying here. The location is perfect to take in Boston. There are many points of Boston within walking distance, but if walking isnt your thing there is a T stop a short distance away. Everything was clean and well kept.

Highly recommended.

There are several reasons why you stay at the Carney Familybr br1 The price is far too low compared to what you get. We slept in a lovely and perfectly clean room with new towels, fresh bed linnen, bathrobes and even new slippers.br2 The Carney Family is so kind and responsive to any request you might have. br3 It is easy to get around Boston from here because the Savin Hill subway station is just nearby. br4 The breakfest you can get a McKennas  just near Savin Hill Station  is absolutely fanstastic. Its greasy but even if there is no room at the Carney Family, you should consider going there. br5 There is a good cup of coffee waiting for you in kitchen when you get up. br6 When we arrived we welcomed by Barney who had some very good sugestions on where to go.brbrAll in all, it was really nice laid back atmosphere that greeted us at the Barney family. And staying there difinitely improved our stay in Boston. This is by far the best experience weve had on AirBnB.

The Carneys got our vacation off to a great start. Mary was waiting for us on the front porch when we arrived and gave us a very warm welcome into their home.  We met Barney as we were finishing our tour and helped ourselves to homemade cookies   We had great access to the T, a large, comfortable room, and the best coffee in town.   The only wrinkle in our stay was some noise from others who were up earlier than us in the house, which led us to get up a bit earlier than we had planned.  Other than that, we had a fantastic stay with the Carney family.  One unexpected treat was the pleasant breakfast we shared with a couple from Australia. We shared stories and laughs over tea, coffee, and bagels.  A great place to stay in Boston

First thing about our stay that must be mentioned was the hospitality. We were made to feel very welcome, with the Carneys taking great care to explain the location of everything in the house.brbrWe were told to help ourselves to whatever was in the fridge, and they even went out of the way to make muffins for usdeliciousbrbrSecondly, the room and board. brbrThe house is old but very well maintained. There is a sense of history that is almost palpable. The room was big and had most things you could possibly need, the only exception being a TV, but honestly, to us it was no loss. The bed was big and comfortable and the ambience made us feel relaxed.brbrFinally, the location.brbrThe house is very well located, 510min from the MBTA station. Downtown and most of the attractions are within a 30 minute journey. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and welcoming.brbrAll in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.brbr

The house was lovely. I stayed in the Master Bedroom, which was very spacious with high ceilings and lots of windows. It was as clean as one would expect, and I arrived to a pitcher of water and instructions on the mantle on how to access WiFi, taxis, etc.brbrIt was my first time sharing a washroom, and while it is not my personal preference to walk through a common area to get to one, there were no issues and it was available when I needed it.brbrI never actually met my host Barney, though he was incredibly helpful in our messages. He provided plenty of directions and was proactive in contacting me. I did briefly encounter Mary, who had a rather loud speaking voice, but who was very friendly.brbrI felt safe in the neighbourhood.

It was one of the most amazing rooms Ive ever stayed in. Location was quiet but with superb access to city centre. Place was spacious. Totally clean. Barney is really friendly person and great host. His muffins were ready for us every morning and we wouldnt leave one We loved the veranda, where you could sit and chill out. The living room where you sit and chill out. The beds where you could slouch and, well, chill out. We also made some great friends during our stay and were realy enjoying the time in Boston which was great deal thanks to Carneys family hospitality.

The listing was accurate. The room was comfortable with a separate shared bathroom. The layout was a little unusual though as you had to walk through the shared kitchen  living area to reach the bathroom. The location was in a pretty suburb of Boston. Younger people might prefer to stay right in the bustle of the centre, but as we were travelling with a young child we werent planning on late nights out. This location turned out well as it was considerably cheaper than staying in the centre but only a 20min train journey away from Boston Common in the centre. We didnt really see much of our hosts apart from a brief meeting.

The master bedroom at Barneys place was charming, clean and spacious. The place was fairly close to the train station and thus accessible. Barney was friendly and helpful. It was a little cold at night as there was no heat but was not a big problem, and I wish there was a key to the room as there were other guests sharing the place.

The Carney family has hosting down to a science. If you noticed the cleaning fee, let me tell you that it is well worth it. They have hired people to clean and you will feel like you are in a hotel except linens go in the basket in the bathroom. Barney puts out muffins in the morning, one for each guest, so enjoy that will a cup of coffee or tea. There will be several other guests coming and going. We liked that and enjoyed visiting with some of them. Public transportation is close by. We took the train into town and it was very easy with a little help from the station worker. The Carneys will leave a paper in your room with lots of information, including restaurant referrals. I can tell you that the pizza place is tasty also, they only take cash, heads up.brOverall, great place, great value. I feel lucky that we were able to book them book early.

All aspects of my visit to the Carney Family home were positive. Barney had excellent communication with very precise instructions for the location of their home and the free parking on premise.

Michelle seemed like a lovely woman and I can see why people would enjoy her company. However I felt as though there was a discrepancy with the photos of the room and the actual room. The room was extremely dusty and dirty despite Michelle saying that the place is professionally cleaned. I found quite a few dead bugs in the room that shouldve been cleaned up. There was also a lot of flies, spiders, and centipedes in the room. The sink and the tub was constantly plugged and the water would always fill up even as I was just brushing my teeth. There were brown stains on the bottom of the tub and the shower was extremely slow. I had to wash my hair by dumping buckets of water on my head. On top of the hygiene factor, I also found that the area was unsafe. Upon arrival I already saw a bunch of men under house arrest hanging around our area and they gave myself and my friend quite a hard time by following us around and catcalling us. This happened over the next few days  being followed and being called extremely nasty things. After some investigation, I also found that a man was shotstabbed repeatedly just a few blocks away from Michelles home. That made me feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe, and I actually had to book a hotel for the last night. Although everyones tolerance for hygiene and safety is different, I found it unbearable to stay even one more night at Michelles home.

Michelle is a great host Shes so receptive to requests and the sweetest person ever. The room is very spacious and I loved the walkin closet. The bed is also very comfortable. The neighborhood is usually very quiet and people are very nice. Its a good walk to the train station but its nice and not that far of a ride from the Downtown area. Overall, Michelle is great and Im going to miss her very much. She also makes awesome baked goodies

I had a great time at Michelles She was great, she baked muffins and pies for us, and checked on us regularly. I stayed at her house for two months, during which we all had dinner together three or four times, we decorated a Christmas tree in the living room, she took us to a Christmas party that a friend of hers was hosting, and even took me sleddingbrThe room is exactly as advertised I specially liked the closet, which you could even call a walkin closet, and if youre visiting in winter, as I did, youll find it sooo warm and cozy The house is in a quiet residential neighbourhood that means there are no shops nearby, but within walking distance to the T 10 minutes and the Museum of Fine Arts 20 minutes.

Michelle is a wonderful host, she was always checking in to make sure we were alrig and we had food. She welcomed me on my first day and show me all the way to the train station and to Longwood Medical Area in spite of the cold and the fact that it was already late in the evening. She baked fpr us sometimes. The house is beautifil, clean and warm and has all the necessary things. I reccomend the place for students completing electives with Harvard Exchange clerkship program, since it is within walking distance to Longwood Medical Area most of the hospitals are. The T station, restaurants and a grocery shoping are also within ealking distance. I had a great time at. Michelles and hope I can visit again soon

I had a really great time at Rosalias place. It was very easy to communicate with her before hand and the place was easy to find. The apartment itself is great. Very cosy place and a very friendly pet rabbit named jack. Rosalia is an incredibly warm and welcoming person that makes you feel right at home. The apartment is located in a beautiful part of town and very quite.

I had a great stay with Rosalia. She was easy to get in touch with to arrange arrival and was flexible by allowing me to keep my bag in the room while I was out sightseeing. The room was clean and comfortable and the house is in a great location. Easy walking distance to public transportation and sightseeing. brbrMy one tip this is not a complaint, just a tip the walls are thin, so if you have to be in bed early or are sensitive to noise, you might want to bring ear plugs.

Rosalia is very warm and welcoming. She is very informative and generous in sharing what she knows. She reccommended restaurants to for dinner when I arrived and it turned to be a great choice.

I highly reccommend this place to anyone visiting Boston.

The room and space are as promised. Clean, organized and well located in the Charlestown neighborhood. I did not see Rosalia, but she provided everything that I needed for my stay to be pleasant. brbrThe only problem, which I do not believe to have been at all intentional or normal, was that I was unable to get into the property and was forced to walk through the rain with my bags in order to find a place to stay dry. I am disappointed that no attempt to compensate me for this very unpleasant experience was made. I waited to write this review in order to allow Rosalia the opportunity to make up for the unpleasant arrival experience.

I stayed at Rosalias place for 6 months while working at MGH at Navy Yard. For that purpose, the location was perfect short walk to work 15min, quiet neighborhood and short walk 510min to orange line Tstation. Rosalia was nice and easy going, which made it easy to live in her apartment and sometimes we had interesting discussions. Room and bed were very comfortable bed is probably too short for a person taller than 180cm. Cleaning lady visited every other week, which ensured that the apartment was nice and clean. Fridge was continuously rather full, but I always managed to find spot for my food. Last, but not least, Jack and Cooper were very cute and well behaving Hidden by Airbnb

The entry way  and the front door is messy, at least for me. There were some other problems I reported to Nick, yet I DO believe they are solvable. Although they are not included in the space I rented for, it is definitely part of the life there. Everybody will like going out in the morning greeted by a tidy, clean, pretty environment.

Such a great price too If you dont mind 3060 minutes on public transportation into the city this place is great  we would walk 5 minutes to the bus stop and ride our way into the city

Excellent host, great response, very clean and exactly as described  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a place near Boston.

As this is my girlfriend and Is first airbnb experience, we were somewhat nervous. However we were quickly put to ease when we walked into a lovely, clean, well decorated basement apartment. For the price, this place couldnt get any better. The kitchen is clean and has all the utilities you could need. The bathroom has a great shower and is also very clean. The house included a big TV which lots of free channels as well as free and fast wifi Its also close to bus routes and the T tram line. Which is perfect for getting in and out of Boston. 1010 for this place I would definitely recommend it to anyone

My wife and I really enjoyed our short time in Boston at Nicks place. Lots of places nearby for a quick bite or sit down meal. The apartment is great, especially the kitchen. Parking can be a little tight if you have a minivan like we did, but Nick was really flexibleconsiderate with the parking arrangements.  Likewise Nick was very responsive to all of our messages. The bed was super soft and the space was generally quiet, save some neighborhood noise on the night of the Bruins game they lost in overtime. Thanks again to Nick, well definitely recommend to friends heading that way.

Great basement suite Bigger than it looks in the pictures. Great cafes and restaurants within walking distance. A great spot
facilities positive
Although the kitchen is very nice, and the shower is large, I wouldnt recommend this place because the noise from the tenant above, through no fault of his own, just travels right into the basement apartment, including a 4am trip to the bathroom and flushing. The bed is saggy and uncomfortable, and for some reason the Tempurpedic pullout bed in the living room was nonexistent so my daughter was told to sleep on the sofa. I would not rent it again, even though there were good things about it. I fully expect an angry rant just as the woman who dared to give a negative review below received. Thats fine.

Nicks place is great for a couple.  My wife and I stayed 2 weeks and would stay here again.  The kitchen was fully equipped with new appliances, the bed was supercomfy, the shower was the best of any Airbnb weve stayed in, very strong wifi.  Its very convenient to bus and train  510 minute walk to either.  Park your car in back and take the T.

Nicks place is a cool basement apartment that was actually larger than I expected. I spent a week there recovering from surgery, laid up on the couch the whole time, and had a great stay. The wonderful kitchen and large TV helped greatly in that capacity. Nick was incredibly responsive to any questions or concerns I had and was a great host. Since I was recovering, I didnt get to explore the area too much, but found some cool little places to eat and some nice stores. I would certainly recommend for anyone visiting the area

Host was a good communicator and let us use the washerdryer even though it wasnt advertised.  We didnt rent a car, but my daughter was often visiting so the host left the parking spot empty for her her use. . . Very much appreciated.  The space was a little cramped since we had 3 adults, but the host provided a inflatable queen mattress for our adult daughter to use.  When the mattress was stowed, the space was nice for relaxing when we were not touristing.

Kevin and Fran have an awesome house Lots of stairs but very stylish and homely feeling. The house was kept warm, the spaces clean, and the comfort unparalleled. The hilltop home has INCREDIBLE views of downtown Boston and the surrounding area. There is a metro station a short walk from the house making it very easy to get around, or if you are feeling a stroll it takes only about 40 minutes to walk to downtown Boston. There are a few grocery stores within a few minutes of the house, and I had unrestricted access to the   wellaccessoried kitchen. All in all it was a fantastic stay, and I would not hesitate to recommend Kevin and Frans hospitality to anyone

I spent six months at Kevins place during a research internship in the Longwood Medical Area. The house is amazing, very spacious, inviting, bright and clean. The furniture and oriental rugs in all of the rooms will make you feel at home right away. The house is located in a very nice part of Roxbury, on Fort Hill. As a 20 yearold female student, I have not once felt unsafe in this neighborhood. While very safe, it unfortunately is quite a walk to the next supermarket, which will not be tragic for any ablebodied person who enjoys walking. This is the perfect place to stay if you are in Boston for a short or longterm research period. It is easy to get along with the other houseguests, as they are mostly also in the research field and always up for a good conversation about science, but also respect quiet times in the house. The biweekly cleaning service of the common areas is very convenient and the kitchen has everything you could need, from a coffee machine to an air fryer and Tupperware, many things that have been left behind by previous residents. This is a very old house, which makes it especially endearing, however it can also be quite drafty when Boston winter hits. I could not have imagined a better accommodation during my time here, and I am so glad I found this place

Brookes place was nice for a weekend getaway to Boston. The space was tidy, but not all that centrally located.

Gianni is a very nice person. After welcoming us, he made the tour of his house showing where things were. The 2 level apartment is absolutely clean and new. The couches in the living room were very comfortable. The kitchen had all the tools needed for cooking which was perfect for us.  Although the bedroom was downstairs, it was really comfortable. We could open the window in the nights to get fresh air. Bathroom was ideal. Supermarket is at 10 minutes walking distance and you can get to downtown in 7 stops with the orange line. I definitely recommend Giannis place to all travellers.

It is a really nice space with lots of space, a great kitchen, living area and comfortable bedroom. It is in a nice quiet neighbourhood but only 5 minutes to the subway station and so easy to get into downtown Boston and tofrom the airport. For Boston, we found it to be excellent value for money.

This place is really great Super spacious, clean, in a very quiet and homely neighbourhood and very close to the Metro Station where you can catch trains going into Boston Town, Harvard or MIT. There is a field just right in front of the house that you can use as your jogging track. I loved the idea of having a half bathroom in the upper floor of the house you dont have to walk down the stairs to use the main bathroom in the lower level.

Terrific place. Convenient location. Very clean. The two sofas were very comfortable and offered great seating for visiting and watching tv. The fold out sofa bed was great. The downstairs bedroom was roomy and provided some privacy.   I had a bit of trouble with the WiFi but my son didnt seem to have the same difficulty.   We were visiting northeastern university and this location was great for that. Easy access to Ubers as well.  We would definitely stay here again.

Had a very positive  three night stay at the urban oasis. Both Kelly and Phil were gracious hosts, the third floor where we stayed was clean and accurate to the description. For myself and two sons of 15 the short bus or tram ride to the center of Boston was easy. Also the small Main Street of Jamaica Plain was close by and made for easily accessible shops and restaurants.

Great property, great location and very welcoming hosts. We had the whole of the third floor to ourselves, including a kitchenette and separate bathroom. The milk in the fridge meant we could have a cup of tea on arrival, which was very welcome after our long journey. The beds were very comfy and the whole place was very clean. It is only five minutes walk to the T Green station on the Orange line so we were able to get around very easily. JP itself is lovely...walks around the pond, a small drugstore for breakfast supplies, restaurants, everything you need really. We did not see much of our hosts but they were very friendly when we did see them. We could come and go as we pleased and did not feel at all awkward sharing their house. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston.

We were in town to install an art work over the weekend an Phil was incredibly helpful. Beyond the comfortable apartment, he provided much easier storage for the piece.

My husband and I  enjoyed our stay at Kelly and Phils. We enjoyed the convenience of the neighborhood. There are lots of interesting restaurants, shops, and grocery possibilities as well as places to walk, run or do tourist type activites. All of the beds were extremely comfortable and the space fit our needs for a whirlwind trip to Boston. The hosts provided breakfast essentials which were appreciated because we arrived too late to shop. Although there is a shared entrance to their living space it was not a problem. We felt we had plenty of privacy in the third floor unit. My husband and I would definitely return.

Kellys place was perfect for us.  The location allowed for walkability to my daughters house as well as the main town area and public transportation. Three of us stayed utilizing both bedrooms.  I stayed in the king room.  The room is spacious and the bed comfortable.  Only possible suggestion would be to add an outlet strip for electronic devices.  The 2nd bedroom had 2 twin beds which I was told were also very comfortable.  Plenty of towels were available as well as shampooconditionerbody soap.  The kitchen was perfect for quick breakfasts having a toaster oven, microwave, small refrigerator, sink, and coffee maker.brAlthough you share the same entrance as the family we ran into them only twice, at the beginning and the last night.  With the accommodations on the third floor you have your privacy. I would recommend Kellys place to friends.

Kellys place is in a great location, a stones throw from the bustling Central Street where you can find good restaurants, cafes, shops and yoga studios Only 8 minutes to the train station, so it was easy access to downtown.

Lovely space in a beautiful house just right off of the main strip in JP.

We had a lot of fun exploring Boston and were very happy with our stay. The location, on a quiet street, was a perfect home base for us, with quick and easy access to the local T station and bus stops which are both just a short walk away.brBesides the lovely architecture of this and many of the homes in the neighbourhood, we couldnt have been happier with the hospitality of our hosts, who were more than happy to offer suggestions and tips in response to our questions.

The description of the home was very accurate.

She was super nice and was willing to help us with whatever we needed. 10 out of 10 for her.

Fiona is a lovely person, warm and friendly.  We only saw her once at beginning when she gave us the keys.  The location was great, a short walk to Rozzy village.  For older people, house lighting was too dim and beds too low for us. The bathroom was older but adequate, but the shower somewhat slippery with no hold bar.  Fiona had great appliances and cookware, but the counter space was limited.  She left us lots of treats  wine, chocolates, fruit, and nuts.

Thomas was a great host We didnt see him much but we communicated through text. His place was a little further out of the city than we wanted to stay but it worked out because the train station was only a 12 minute walk and it took us to where we wanted to go, We basically just needed a shower and a comfortable bed to sleep and thats what we got. We were out all day and came back for a shower and bed. His dog was nice and she does not bark.

Phyllis beautiful home is located in a very quiet and conveniently located neighborhood where you can find restaurants, shops, laundry, banks and literally anything you need. Public transportation is very close and Phyllis is always available to give you directions and recommendations. The house is lovely, full of details, art work, stylish furniture and always impeccable. Rooms are very comfortable, bed was great and the shared bathroom is huge and has everything you wish for in a bathroom...Breakfast includes a variety of choices of tea and coffee from all over the world, fruits, cereal, all types of milk, you name it. And the daily baked cookies... out of this world

We just spent 5 nights in Boston with Bruce and Barry and loved it. They are warm and friendly, have a charming and comfortable home in a nice quiet neighborhood.

Barry and Bruce are wonderful hosts and made me feel right at home. By the end of the week, I felt as if they were longtime friends of mine. The room is lovely and the bed very comfy  I slept like a log.  The house is clean and nicely appointed, with an especially welcoming kitchen.  The porch, yard and gardens are also quite pleasant.  brThe location on Savin Hill is ideal.  A majestic old neighborhood with quiet streets, but a subway stop only a short walk away. Also the home is only a few blocks from a neighborhood retail district that includes several good restaurants. A brief subway ride takes you right into the heart of Boston.

My husband and I very much enjoyed our brief stay with Bruce and Barry and their two cute miniature poodles. We ended up staying in a different room so I cant comment directly on this room. The bed we had was very comfortable, the room furnishings were fun and eclectic, and we had a fan to keep us cool at night. The bathroom is a shared bath, but we didnt see or hear anyone else use it, so it felt like a private bathroom. Note There were two different full baths available for guest use. The neighborhood is beautiful you can actually see the water from their street and we felt very safe walking back to the house from the subway.  We didnt spend any time on the veranda, but it looked lovely and there were many beautiful plants and flowers. There are two rooms in the house that are for AirBNB use and other rooms are rented out longterm to students. These are mostly students doing graduate work, so its very quiet and not at all a party atmosphere. There are breakfast items available in the morning as well as a filtered water dispenser, tea  coffee available at any time. We were on the 3rd floor which was fine for us, but just a point for anyone who has difficulty with stairs. A very nice experience and we would not hesitate to stay here again.

This particular room is large and clean, the bed is comfortable, and it has both an AC unit and a space heater This came in really handy since I had a couple days of high humidity followed by cold, windy rain. The morning light is great for waking up naturally and you can serve yourself breakfast in the wellappointed downstairs kitchen.brbrShared bathrooms were really clean. Theres another upstairs from this room in case someone is using the one on the same floor. I LOVED the heated air you can turn on.brbrAs a single female traveler I was a little concerned that there werent locks on the room doors, but it wasnt a problem at all. I had a doorstop for peace of mind, but otherwise it was unnecessary. I was also a little concerned when I mapped the walk from the station to the house, but its a safe neighborhood. Quiet in a good way, but not too quiet. The walk is quick and the red line was really convenient for getting to or connecting to other parts of the city. Quick transfer to the silver to the airport, too.brbrBruce and Barry can give you tips on where to eat and what to see in the city. Their home is really beautiful. They had pumpkins out for Halloween.  The dogs are fun when youre coming back for the evening. I would definitely stay here again

There is a cute little kitchenette and a table with 2 chairs for dining. There is a small closet to hang clothing. It does get chilly in the space, but there are 2 heaters to keep the place warm. I feel like I really got lucky with this place and the hosts. Caitlin texted me to ensure everything was OK and I had everything I needed, which was great. I highly recommend this place to anyone.

We didnt meet Caitlin and Dan, as they were away visiting family for our one night stay,  but their concern for their guests shows in the care they take to provide for your needs in this little studio apartment. They sent clear directions to get to their place, provided information about the neighborhood and everything you could need for your stay  comfortable bed, TV, small fridge and microwave, dishes and cutlery, lots of towels in the bathroom. There is a small table for eating inside, and another outside on the private deck where you enter. The location was very convenient, on a quiet street with offstreet parking, but only 5 mins. from a busier street with restaurants, stores and the orange line which will take you anywhere.

We opened the door to the huge deck and with the breeze it was great Extremely close to the T orange line, 5 min walk, which was what we needed to make getting in and out of the city easy.

He was generous with advice about where to go  what to see, both in Boston and in the immediate neighbourhood. The accommodation has a nice private feel, and is decorated and equipped with great style, not forgetting the especially comfy bed The area is currently being dug up, but we found several nice places to eat nearby without any trouble despite the roadworks the pleasant neighbourhood of Jamaica Plain is a manageable walk away too.

Apartment was exactly as described and pictured. Very comfortable, clean, and safe. Having the kitchen area was also very convenient. The only thing that stopped me from giving this a 5 star rating was the smell and air inside the apartment. It smelled of mildew and mold.

We only stayed one night in the studio, but it was incredibly cozy and we could not have been more pleased. We took a red eye from SFO and were exhausted by the time we arrived. Caitlin and Dan were generous enough to get everything ready a little before the checkin time, so that we could take a muchneeded nap. I dont know if the mattress is memoryfoam or what, but it was glorious. The neighborhood feels tucked away on a little hill, but we were able to walk to a nice dinner around the corner. All we really did after that was come back and watch Christmas movies in bed, but it was perfect. It was freezing outside, but we were toasty warm in the studio. We would have loved to have more timethe T was right there, and there was a great park down the street. Even so, thank you Caitlin and Dan for such a relaxing little place

The place is beautiful and feels like a five star hotel. Trader Joes shower amenities were provided which was a nice touch. The bed is extremely comfortable, and the back porch with a table was a cool place too eat breakfast at. Less than five minute walk to train station. I also love the check in procedure. We got there a little late because of car trouble, but we just parked and walked in. No hassle. If I come back to Boston I will surely try and stay here again.

Great access to public transit for exploring the city The suite is very private and has great amenities, including a small fridge, dishes, hair dryer, etc. Bed was comfy and the place has a generally cozy feel. Caitlin  Dan have thought of all the little details, like supplying shampoo and providing maps and sightseeing info. We ate at the Dogwood, one of their recommended spots, and it was excellent brWe appreciated the ability to park our car in the driveway for the duration of our stay, as it was much easier to get around on the T than it would have been to drive.

Caitlin and Dans third floor apartment was perfect for us. We love staying in Jamaica Plain, away from the craziness of the city. The T station was only steps away and Centre St, where you will find all the great restaurants and cafes was only a 2030 min walk. The apartment isnt fully air conditioned but there are fans in every room and a window air conditioner in the bedroom, which was perfect. We were there when it was 35 degrees Celsius outside and didnt have any issues. And the bed was amazing. Could have slept for days I would recommend Caitlin and Dans place to any traveller looking to stay in that area.

Our stay was nice in Boston but not great. The mattress was five stars as it was the most comfortable on our trip. The bathroom cleanliness shower was concerning and not what I anticipated. The pictures of the bathroom on the listing are a bit deceiving. The shower curtain definitely has to be replaced. Broken drawers on the dresser in the bedroom made it look below average. The handle on the door with the key pad leading into the apartment was loose, needs tightening. We tried using the TV the one night and I dont know if there was a connection error but it wasnt working properly and wouldnt load. All in all a good stay to what we were trying to accomplish, a cheaper stay outside the city. The parking was very convenient and we felt safe leaving our car. The coffee shop the hosts recommended was one of the top on our overall trip. I think its just an attention to detail really. The space looks a little worn due to a lot of traffic and multiple stays from so many guests. Hosts need to take a moment to make a few slight adjustments and updates to make the bang worth the buck to its max. Regardless, quick responses and again that bed was amazing

The house is lovely and in a beautiful part of Boston. Quiet, family neighborhood. The house was clean but had a strong odor I think it was cat urine. Emmanuel was not flexible on check in key pick up and as a result my husband had to leave my graduation reception to accommodate him. The sheets were old and covered in pills. Emmanuel also never answered when I asked him after our stay if he saw my grandmothers raincoat in the closet. He could at least respond to the question. All around would not recommend Emmanuel as a host or the house.

We booked this house in January for a July vacation. It was listed as a single family with 1.5 baths and laundry.  Emmanuel was gracious to let us in at 1pm to drop off our stuff. We found the house clean for the most part, but only 1 bath and no laundry  This was not a major inconvenience, but not what I paid for. We were not informed of the house being remodeled.  The cabinet where the pots were kept was dirty and the bathroom had used soap in the tub.  Also, there were wires sticking out of the wall in the hall. Most of the plugs in the house were 2 prong so we had to get adapters and an extension cord. The walk to the train took every bit of 20 min. The binder of pamphlets with sites to see and directions was helpful. Emmanuel did say he was keeping his car in the garage, of which we heard a few times. But he failed to mention that he was staying in the cellar as well  After 3 days of running around Boston we figured that out and found it unsettling, but did not have enough time to change our accommodations. AGAIN THIS WAS LISTED AS A SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE That is what I paid for and would not have stayed knowing all this now. We also found the traffic noise was quite excessive, even with the air conditioners running, since you can see a two lane rotary from the front window. It was also hard to sleep hearing the sirens from the ambulances to the hospital 3 blocks away I would not recommend staying there due to the noise factor and the misrepresentation of this being a single family house.

The host made us  welcome. The house looked as it was on the website and was  comfortable but was smaller than what it looked like on the website.

While a little hard to initially find, our clients were thrilled to pieces with Emmanuels home and found it very easy to access public transportation and otherwise get around.brbrEmmanuel responded to any questions immediately, and was in frequent contact with me throughout their stay.

The neighborhood was good, we slept good.  The room was slightly different than I expected and not for the better.  The bathroom was a little outdated but it worked.  The  balcony from our room could only be accessed by climbing out the window.  Im agile so it was no problem, just a little awkward.  The house overall was neat and clean.  I suggest getting a ride to her house though from the train as the house is at the top of a long hill.  We were pooped after pulling our luggage on a hot day.  Going TO the station was no problem though, as it was downhillbrbrAll in all the was a good value though and we had a pleasant stay.  Jessica was very nice.

For my first stay with Airbnb i had lowered the bar, not knowing what i was in for. I was blown away by Jessica and her home and it far exceeded my wildest dreams. The home was  eclectic with a homey vibe. It was clean and had plenty of amenities like a cute balcony for me to relax on, tea to drink , air conditioning, a bathtub etc. Checking in was a snap, and I had all the space i needed for my 3 day stay. She leaves you with instructions and directions and is accessible by text.The neighborhood is a quiet one with the Red train line accessible by a short 45 block walk although the last two are UP a steep hill But Uber, you can get to and from the city at a low cost.

The Rosenbergs home is very welcoming, friendly, and most importantly comfortable.

This was a great location, and a very comfortable room with private bathroom. We came and went undisturbed. It is a beautiful old home in the middle of Brighton. Mrs. Rosenberg met us upon arrival, showed up the rooms and gave us our key. She was very kind and had all sorts of coffeeteasnackscerealmilk set out as well as extra blankets in the room. There were two twin beds in one room and a second room with a crib and twin bed in case we needed it. We walked to a variety of coffee shops in the morning and the neighborhood was very safe.

Yossi parents house is elegantly decorated and is located close to downtown Boston for people with cars. The rooms are super clean, and the beds are comfy. The kitchen was fine for us since we only ate breakfast at home and didnt require any cooking.brbrThe biggest drawback was that the bathroom is located within one of the two bedrooms, so people who live in that bedroom dont have much privacy. There was a sliding screen that tried to separate the sleeping area from the passage to the bathroom, but unfortunately the screen was broken, so we had to hang a bedding sheet up to visually separate the spaces. brbrOtherwise, everything was pretty good. The checkin was smooth despite our late arrival. We figured out the parking space ourselves, with the assistance of a friendly neighbor. The area is quiet and safe at night, and there is a beautiful reservoir nearby and is good for morning joggers.

We stayed on the second floor of Yossis parents house. There are two bedrooms, in one of which is where the bathroom is located.

Moving from California to Boston, especially on September 1st, can be a bit chaotic. I used this AirBnB to help with the transition to an apartment a few blocks away. I wasnt looking for anything fancy, just a comfortable place stay while I transition to my new home. This space fit the bill perfectly and took a lot of stress off of our move. Yossis father checked us in and was polite and extremely thorough regarding the amenities. I had several pieces of large luggage that he was nice enough to store downstairs since the room was a bit small for my extra bags. I appreciated the snacks, large fridge, mini kitchen, and especially the AC during these hot days.  It was easy to come in and out without disturbing the residents, creating a nice sense of privacy in a shared space. Thank you very much for helping ease our move to Boston.

I  would not recommend having a car there because everything is so convenient. My son stayed with us one night on the pullout couch, and parked in a nearby paid lot recommended by the hosts.

Cindy  Marks place is in an unbeatable location. We spent four days exploring Boston with our two young kids and the home served as a superconvenient startingending point for day of our adventures. Though small, the home was very clean and provided all the essentials for our family of four  a place to cook, enough room for us to sleep comfortably, and a safe location to return to even late at night. Cindy  Mark informed me that the dryer would be unavailable for use during our stay, but as they correctly pointed out to me prior to our arrival, laundry services are conveniently located just a short walk away. A great Italian bakery is just around the corner, as were numerous dining options and historic sites. We would definitely recommend staying here

I stayed in Lauras place for three months and I admit that expectations met reality. The apartment was very stylish and beautiful. Due to studying, I had to stay in the apartment for many hours and it was very important for me that I felt like I was home. I also really appreciated Laura. She never bothered me as you know other landlords do but she was also always there to help me with what I needed. For me she is the ideal host. Regarding the location, I have to say it is very convenient since you are very close to the centre but at the same time the neighborhood is quiet and you can find whatever you need Starbucks, convenience stores, pizza, small cosy restaurants etc.brI would undoubtedly recommend this place to student or even a couple or a family. Thank you Laura

Pros Great location with well known Boston cafes within a few blocks, walking distance to Copley Plaza and Back Bay, very safe lively neighborhood.brbrCons Very small boxy shower about 3 feet across, very small toilet and sink the size of a shoe box. Very small Square bedroom the size of a closet , maybe 7 by7 feet head to toe with thin transparent curtain looking out onto the neighbors though a tree covers most parts. I was surprised when prior to our departure, we received instructions to take the trash outempty the garbage when we had paid a days worth of rental additionally specifically for cleaning. I felt the most disappointing part of this well located place are the few things I mentioned as Cons.brbrOverall if location is a major priority , I understands customers may continue to choose this place. Finally this is not your traditional Airbnb model based on the founding principles of home owners welcoming you into their space. The owner does not live on the property and we did not meet her though her  responsiveness was great and rapid through text.

Glenn handled the necessary arrangements and Kevin was there to greet us at the lovely brownstone townhouse in the Victorianstyle neighbourhood of South End. The cosy apartment was exactly as described, and then some. There was a hair dryer, hangers, bath supplies and basic kitchen condiments e.g. flour, sugar, salt, pepper and oil, which were handy. The location was safe and within a few paces of a convenience store and laundromat. Our taxi ride from the airport was about 30. Overall, my friends and I had a very enjoyable stay here. Thanks again

This apartment is essentially a hotel, and I do not mean that in a good way. It is a buytolet property. For me, the joy of Airbnb is the homeawayfromhome feel and the opportunity to connect with local hosts even if you dont meet them. This apartment is managed by a short term rental agency. I never had any contact with Brent. Immediately after the booking was accepted, I was sent a separate contract by the agency. The listing does make clear that the property is managed by a property management company, but I hadnt appreciated how impersonal that would make the experience. This is exactly the kind of listing that has been getting Airbnb into trouble in New York Website hidden by Airbnb Whilst I cant argue with the accuracy of the listing, I strongly belief that these kind of properties are against the spirit and ethos of Airbnb, and I would not recommend staying here.

Oh, and do go a few extra blocks to try The Blue Nile Ethiopian Restaurant sometime during your stay.  Its worth getting in the car for a short drive, but if you choose to stay on the main shopping area on Centre, Ill not hold you to blame.  We could easily have done just that.  brbrAlso, do enjoy the lovely cottage gardens surrounding the house, and the front porch, and the ample parking if you drive.

Stayed at Tims place for two nights for a busy weekend and cannot stress how great the location is.  5 minute walk from Back Bay station, less than 10 minute Uber to the theatre district, minutes to great food and bars.  Tims place is cozy and tastefully decorated, and the back deck would be perfect for enjoying drinks on a nice evening but it was brutally hot and humid during my time there.  The apartment does not have central AC which was fine by me there was a window unit in the bedroom but might be something to keep in mind.  Also the bathroom is quite small though functional and spotless so if youre super tall or a large individual keep that in mind as well.  I will definitely keep this place in mind for future weekend visits.

This brownstone is in the south end, which is an okay place to stay. We ended up walking over toward downtown each day we were there as that was where most things were that we wanted to do. Just depends on what youre looking for. Next time Ill probably stay in Beacon Hill. But you can walk to most anything from here if you dont mind a little exercise We ended up paying quite a bit for this place, probably more than its worth. Especially since we also had to pay 38 a day for parking down the street. Overall it was good, just expensive.

Tims apartment is absolutely lovelybrbrThe pictures here do not do it justice. Its chic and really perfectly appointed. It is tastefully decorated, clean and so cozy. The bed is incredibly comfortable and I absolutely appreciated the quality linens. The kitchen had everything I needed. While the bathroom is small, it is perfectly serviceable and the shower is fabulous The little porch is perfect for a glass of wine after a long day of travel and sight seeing. You really feel you are living a local Boston life in this charming apartment. brbrThe location is absolutely perfect. Walkable to anything you could imagine,  including fun little restaurants and public transportation. brbrTim was an exceptional host, making everything an absolute breeze to coordinate.

This place is amazing The location is perfect to get around the city. We loved staying here and will definitely stay again when we come back to Boston. I do want to note that being an old building the thermostat did hover around 67 degrees Fahrenheit. This was great at night as we snuggled in the super comfortable bed under the down comforter however I would recommend a nice sweater and warm slippers for during the day. I was a bit chilly working on my computer during the day. I do want to note again that we loved the pace and would absolutely stay again

Everything about Tims place and the glowing reviews others have written were spot on. I was very comfortable for the one night I stayed. I honestly believe that you would pay double or more for a comparable hotel room in Boston. That about says it all And  although I didnt get to meet Tim in person, he kept in communication very well. I would absolutely stay here again.

The brownstone unit is in a very convenient and scenic location. I love the friendly neighborhood and the experience of staying in a signature old building. The unit is 10 min walk from train station, and  one block from Tremont, where there are many small shops and eateries. Walking in the opposite direction for 10 min, we are in the shopping complex of Copley Center, Prudential Center etc, totally different experience of brand name shopping. The unit is a comfortable, homey and safe quarter, the kitchen is well stocked. I was attending a conference, therefore I did not fully utilize the amenity of the unit.

Tims place was awesome. Its a great location, relatively quiet, even though its in a very hip, walkable area. Comfy bed, hot water, stylish place. I loved the little outdoor balcony. I liked how close so many nice restaurants and shops were. Definitely a very attractive, more affluent part of town. Parking situation is not so great because it is mostly residential parking, but isnt any different than the rest of Boston. There are meters close by, which made it doable for someone like me, who had a rental They are free overnight most nights. Check in was a breeze and Tim was a great communicator.

I actually stayed in a different apartment had some issues switching the reservation on AirBnB but the apartment I stayed at was also rented through Elyne. It was near Government Center and Faneuil Hall. The apartment was on the 2nd floor above an Irish bar. See comments about noise below. It was a lovely openplan one bedroom There was no bedroom door so technically its a studio but the room is separate from the living space. It was very nicely furnished, with a modern updated kitchen and bath. It was clean and spacious. I have already booked to return to this property. However, I will be upfront and say that if you are sensitive to noise, this is not the place for you. There are a row of Irish bar on the block and there is often live music, drunk people screaming until 2am on Thurs  Sat. The weekdays usually quiet down earlier. The bedroom isnt by the front windows so it is a little quieter in the bedroom but if you have people sleeping on the sofa or air mattress in the front room, it can be very loud. I did not mind the noise, I am used to it, but it is definitely something you should be aware of when booking the apartment. Again, this is not for the Beacon Hill one bedroom but another one of Boston Furnished Rentals one bedroom properties.

I stayed in this apartment for 3 months whilst working at a local hospital. The apartment, and Laura as host, made my time a great and hassle free experience The apartment is very modern and intelligently designed making a small space feel very large. The location is ideal with many restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores in Tremont street and the surrounding area, as well as being a 1015 min walk to the T station. The majority of my contact with Laura was via email, to which Laura was very quick to reply, and kept me informed to any happenings in the apartments building. Having met Laura 3 or 4 times she is very easy to talk to, and willing to help with any queries. A great addition to the apartment was an air conditioner that Laura came and installed herself when the temperatures in spring started to rise. Overall  highly recommended no matter what time of year, reason for travel, or length of stay.

I stayed in the apartment for a month in November, it is a very nice apartment with a separate bedroom, a plenty of storage place, and a fully equipped kitchen with all the necessary utensils. It also has a private washerdryer for your use in a basement. It is located in a quite residential neighbourhood. Since I was there in November, it was quite chilly in the apartment on a colder days, but Masha kindly provided me with a small heater. Overall, I had a great stay there and Im glad that I found this apartment for my initial stay in Boston.

We were very pleased with our stay at Mashas place, it was exactely what we had been looking for  proximity to the metro, quiet area and privacy. The apartment was clean and the bed very confortable.

Great value for the money, we will stay here again during our future trips to Boston. Thanks Masha

Dror called very quickly and gave me friendly, thorough information.   The apartment needs some love.   The sofas appeared heavily used and discolored and I was not comfortable enough to sit on them, and the dinning table chairs were stiff and mismatched.   There was no place I was comfortable.  There was no interior lock on the front door and, being a woman staying alone, whenever people walked by in the hall I was a bit uncomfortable.  The bathroom was small but adequate and clean  there were no hand towels.  The kitchen was clean and much nicer than in the photo.  The location is great and this would be a nice place to stay if someone would make a trip to Ikea and spent 34k on new some furniture.     With additional fees I ended up spending 374 for one night.
facilities negative
By far the best thing about this apartment is the location. It really couldnt be better  right in the middle of all the wonderful Italian restaurants and shops in the heart of the North End. It is also very spacious for the price  two bedrooms and a large living room and kitchendining area. The beds were comfortable and there were sufficient essentials kitchenware, towels, etc for our stay. Overall, it was worth the price and I would stay here again. That said, there were some negatives. The heat was an issue. Apparently, the thermostat to this apartment which we never actually found controls the whole floor of the building and cant be adjusted. It was uncomfortably hot in the bedrooms at night. Luckily, we found a fan in one of the closets, but only one. The other problem was that my traveling companion is very allergic to cats. Although the apartment is listed no pets, she immediately had a severe reaction. In her estimation, there was either a cat in the apartment recently, or someone else on the floor had a cat and there were open vents. It was hard for her to spend a large amount of time in the apartment. Again, those issues were not so major that I wouldnt stay here again. It was generally a positive experience.
service negative
The apartment was very nice and comfortable. We stayed there during the crazy Boston blizzard so it was good to have somewhere warm to bunker down. Its located in a good spot to go to the shops for groceries and alcohol, and close to the harbour which no doubt would be very enjoyable during less of a cold snap. Fantastic location, the North End of Boston is excellent for Italian food and culture. High ceilings and nice furniture make the place feel very homely. Had good sleeps with very comfortable bedding. Free internet was a bonus. Also the real estate agent is right next door which is helpful if there are any major problems which we thankfully did not have. The television wouldnt work for us though we played around with it a lot and followed the written instructions, and the couches were a bit dirty. Minor gripes though, for the most part we had a great time and would stay again.

This place is good and bad. Its the first time Ive ever had anything but the most positive things to say and, before this Ive only left 5 stars in every category. brbrThe good Its pretty clean and the location is awesome. brbrThe bad this place lacks that air bnb home feel. Its very expensive and Is Run by an agency so I dont feel at all like Dror was ever in there. The Parking is super expensive. brbrFirst, you get emails saying you have to print this thing and bring it with you. There are a lot of rules about checking in. I was on a long trip with over 5 air bnbs and none I worried about checking into like this one. When I called to verify my check in, it was an agency and after a long hold the girl asked me what time I would be there. I said, how about around 1200 She said check in is at 200 I said so, Ill come at 200 She said that was when check in was. Ok, not bad just not normal air bnb coolness. brbrThere is no food in there. Im writing this review on the same trip from another air bnb. The fridge has some food in it and there are some essentials here like oil and salt. When I leave Ill leave real maple syrup I bought and some other things I bought. Thats normal air bnb goodness. Not at drors place its just kind of cold. Every cupboard is bare. There is only ice.brbrThey recommend the warf parking for 912 a day. I pulled in at 330pm and out at 1000am the next morning. That cost me 43.00. A day starts at 6pm and ends at 1200 wow. It was a scam.  brbrAgain, its no a terrible place, just kind of a hassle to get into and you might be better just staying at a hotel. brbrThe pictures are taken very well and make the place look better than it is, its not bad, just not as nice as those pictures. brbr

I stayed at Christies place for three nights during my work trip to Boston. She had only seven reviews, so I suspect shes a pretty new AirBnB host. However, I was willing to take the risk because the reviews were very good 5 stars.brUnfortunately, my experience didnt match the good reviews. First, the apartment was dirty the counters of my room were dusty with sticky marks, the carpet required vacuuming, the bathroom was dirty and full of hair. Also, based on my previous AirBnB experience, after the arrival hosts usually inform guests about the basics such as where the room and the bathroom are, hands out the key, and tells if the guest is allowed to use the kitchen and the possible WiFi info. Instead, I had to separately ask for this information from the host, and she felt very reluctant to give it to me she was texting. brThe second evening Christie had her boyfriend  visiting her, and I ended up accidentally walking to the bathroom when he has there he didnt lock the door, and I didnt know the bathroom was occupied. Last, I suspect there is at least an occasional pet dogcat in the apartment since there was animal hair in my room and the bathroom, and bowls for water and food on the floor. Luckily Im not allergic. brOn the positive side, Christie was very flexible with the checkin time due to work, I arrived at 11pm, the apartment was easy to find, and well located for my purposes. The bed was very comfortable too.brHowever, I will be using some other place next time.

Christie was a very hospitable host. She  provided help in all aspects of our stay. Her place was approx 8 min walk to the T which would take you in to the city. There was much to do around her place in regards to food and drinks. It was our first airbnb still getting used to being in another strangers place. I assume with experience will evolve comfortability. Only downside was that it was approx 90 degrees outside and 80 degrees inside. Turned the air on to only have it turned off.

A very good experience in Christies place. Everything is as perfect as being my home.

Varouj was great.  We landed very late so he sent via FedEx the keys. brHe also had snacks and fruit waiting for us when we arrived.  The place was as advertised  great apartment in very nice building with a roof deck and Fourth of July fireworks viewing party to boot.

Varouj was very accommodating during our stay. He was able to meet us following our flight and answered all of our questions. We enjoyed the view out the window the most. The street is very busy so sometimes traffic is a little loud, if this bothers you maybe pack earplugs for sleeping, I seemed to sleep just fine though.

The best thing about the apartment is its location.  Boston is a great walking city and we loved the proximity to Copley Place, Fenway, and enjoyed long walks in the City including the Freedom Trail.  The place is neat and tidy and was perfect for our family of four.  The amenities in the apartment were excellent  awesome shower and plenty of bath linens.  Kitchen is compact but adequate and well equipped.  We made all our breakfasts thanks to the proximity to a Whole Foods store right next door.  The large windows in the living and bedroom helped keep the place airy, though you have to deal with a bit of road noise as you are on Mass Ave.  a very busy thoroughfare in Boston.  Overall, a great place for a small family.

We were here for a conference and were pleased about the quick walk to get there each day. We loved our stay here. The place was big and had a very comfy bed. Although there was a mix up with dates, meaning we had to spend a night in a hotel, Varouj was a very nice host and helped us with our bags from place to place. He had everything we needed for accommodation and made sure that we were greeted on site. I would definitely stay here again

Great apartment, very spacious, and with a well equipped kitchen.  Also a short walk to many things, including Fenway Park where we saw a Redsox game, the Newbury Street quality shopping precinct, and Prudential Centre with more great retail and restaurants including Eataly. A Wholefoods Market right across the road made it very easy to stock up on fresh supplies.  A subway stop on the corner also made it simple to get to Boston Common, Downtown, North End little Italy  yum, and Harvard Uni.

Varouj is a very attentive host.  The apartment is centrally located.  However, being by Mass Av makes it a bit noisy and the limited decoration is dated.  If that is not important, this is a great alternative.

The apartment is located in an ideal area of Boston, within a short walking distance of all of Bostons treasures. The apartment is not overly large but is well furnished and fits 4 with no problems. My kids had no complaints about the pullout sofa, which is rare. The bed is comfy, the bathroom functional. We barely used the kitchen but it looked perfect for short stays. The apartment faces the street 3rd floor so some noise in the morning reminded us that we lived downtown. Unbelievable rooftop patio with 360 views of the Boston skyline. Our car was parked for the duration of the stay and we used public transportation and walked across town. Boston has a human feeling to it, unlike NY. The building is secured by a concierge, even late at night. There is a convenience store downstairs and Whole Foods within 5min walking distance. You will love your stay as much as us, we guarantee it

Great apartment Had everything we needed and Jonathan followed up to make sure we got in okay. Would be great to have a hair dryer but everything else was there, very clean and organized and as expected. The building is very nice and in a prime location
facilities positive
Jonathans apartment is located in the perfect part of Boston, with the main attraction of Boston Common within a short stroll, and right on the edge of the beautiful, elite Beacon Hill area. The building is secure, with lovely doormen. The apartment was clean and spacious, and provided most amenities wanted. A drawback was that the shower would at odd times suddenly go scalding hot for a few seconds the only warning being a small change in the sound of the pressure about a millisecond before it abruptly changed. This was unrelated to water use within the apartment. When I gave Jonathan a heads up that the apartment hair dryer was an Australian one not a problem for us, as we had a converter, he went out and bought a new one and put it in the apartment while we were out. While this was a very prompt reaction, and a nice thing to do, it made us slightly uncomfortable because all our belongings were spread out because we hadnt anticipated someone else being there. Please note that Jonathan asked us to sign a complex legal rental agreement after we had booked something not advertised prebooking, which we were wary of because it would have superseded our Airbnb rights. After expressing these concerns, he waived our need to sign it. Overall, though, a good apartment and a fine host.

This Beacon Hill condoapartment is in a great location.  We were there with two small kids, so we were looking for a little space and a centrally located location where we could walk to activities.  Its a 10 minute walk to Faneuil Hall, 15 minutes to the NE Aquarium, and 1 minute to Boston Common.  I believe it is comparably priced to some local hotels, but youll get more space.  We didnt use the stove or oven, but having a kitchen is a big plus.  We would certainly stay here again.

I came to Boston in an effort to help my brother who also lives in Roslindale. I wanted to stay close by which proved a invaluable considering a few days after arrival the entire city was closed to anything but emergency vehicles due to a terrible snow storm. Alan and Marilyn made me feel comfortable right from the start.  When the storm hit, they were incredibly accommodating even providing some extra winter wear so I could walk warmly to my brothers. I had done something with my right Achilles the day before , and by the time I worked and walked back to the house, it was throbbing very badly.  Marilyn was kind enough not only to make me tea to warn me up, but provided some of her topical pain reducers which helped enormously.   brbrSince no one could drive, my hosts were home for 2 days. I helped Alan take some snow weight off of an upper deck and Marilyn was they asked me to join them in a game of Scrabble an invited me to preparing a wonderful soup.  While my laundry was being done,  sit down with them for lunch.  It was truly a wonderful meal made special by my wonderful hosts.  brbrMy room was clean and neat. The bed was firm like I prefer. It was warm and comfy even though the winds were howling outside. Everyday they had a very nice continental breakfast waiting for me, and a big smile greeted me but thats a rarity since they both work. brbrThe only thing that cant be changed is there are quite a few steps to their home and then to the room. After I hurt my Achilles, it was a challenge to get there but I always did.

I thought it was good, Robert is very welcoming and knows a lot of Boston history. The house is very well located, nice neighbourhood and exceptionally well linked, with the station just a couple of meters. The house and the room gives you the feeling you are staying in a relatives old house, lots of stuff everywhere, not clean at hotel standards, but that somehow gives you the homey feeling. I wouldnt recommend it to someone who cant handle the mess.

There were a lot of things to like about my stay here. The locations was truly excellent, the bed was very comfortable, and Robert and the other man living there, whose name Im sorry to say Ive forgotten were very helpful and gracious in welcoming me, carrying my bags to the room, and suggesting things I might do with my time. However, the state of repair and organization to the place itself left a good deal to be desired. The whole place, including the room, is extremely cluttered far more than shown in the photo, which makes it hard to move around and gives the place a clausterphobic feeling. In the bathroom, towel and toilet paper racks are falling off the wall, and the shower door is broken. There was almost no hot water. That being said, I would still consider staying here for a short term visit when youre going to spend most of your time out in the city.

Theres a hill hike to the house so walking down is easy waking back is tougher if you have any issues. The house had some dust issues and spider webs and also some ants. Not a bad place but not the best place ever. The bathrooms were clean and the house was pretty spacious. The kitchen was cute although the dishes were left dirty. The two upstairs rooms were pretty nice but the one in the basement left some of us itchy from dust. Perfect place if it was slightly cleaner.

The guest room is very wellkept and the bed is SO comfortable Lucia was a very welcoming host that made us feel at home her dog, Angus, is also great   We would definitely stay at Lucias house again

Lucia is a great host. She made me feel welcome and gave me lots of tips from Boston. Chatting with her was always very nice. The room is big and the bed is so comfortable I was there for a month for a observership at Childrens Hospital and it was very easy getting there by bus. And Angus is such a nice dog. I definitely recomend staying with Lucia and Angus.

Super convenient location I only needed one bus or could walk to the hospitals, the room was clean and comfortable, plenty of room for my belongings in the closet or dresser and a small desk to write or use my laptop and the bed is very comfortable.  Lucias backyard is a little sanctuary where you can sit and enjoy the flowers, trees and birds, or walk down to Jamaica Pond and enjoy the trail.  Theres a Wholefoods around the corner and a sweet little bistro about 340ft from her home  walk 10 minutes south and find several more shops, bakeries, etc... I recommend Lucias to anyone, she is very sweet and her home becomes yours.... I hope to see her again

I had a wonderful 11night stay at Ella and Wills. They were welcoming and obliging hosts. I was able to get in touch with them with ease and they were very quick to respond. They were kind enough to assist me with sightseeing ideas. They were receptive when I raised a few minor problems and rectified them promptly to ensure my comfort. brbrThe apartment is well located in a good, quiet neighbourhood and is easy to find. There are parks within walking distance and good restaurants and a supermarket a 5 minute walk away. It took about 3040 minutes to get to downtown Boston via bus and subway.

The bedroom and walkin wardrobe were spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the room was air conditioned.

The hosts were gracious it was comfortable and beat staying at a hotel. br

Everything was just as described, and better.  What cannot be conveyed is the warmth of our hosts and how lovely it was to live in a neighborhood with such a nice feel.  Roslindale is like a little town unto itself within the sprawl of Boston.  GREAT food within a few blocks, and the train... but still smalltownish.  Ella and Will had the apartment fitted out so well we loved every minute of our stay

My fianc and I came to Boston for work and a mini getaway. Will and Ella were great hosts Will gave me a tour of the apartment upon checking in. They even left us a nice welcome card and bottle of wine which was a nice surprise. The apartment was clean, quiet, private, had wicked fast internet. I appreciate the fact that Will and Ella respected our privacy as my fianc and I were quite busy and we tend to keep to ourselves anyway. Ella did message me throughout the stay to check in to make sure we were getting around okay and that the apartment was up to par. I especially liked the handmade manual that Ella had put together for the guests which included information on Boston and how to get around on the T routesschedule, sites to visit, restaurantsmenus, etc. It was really helpful and I found myself referring back to it several times The bed was extremely comfortable, appliances and AC worked fine. We have zero complaints and will be coming back to stay at the apartment soon since we loved it and Boston so much We couldnt have asked for a better lodging experience

Cute little apartment in a quiet part of town. Everything was clean and well maintained, perfect for 2 people to stay in. Roslindale had many good restaurants nearby, including a bakery within walking distance that had delicious breakfast sandwiches which was super convenient The ride into the city part of Boston was 1020 minutes depending on traffic andor where you were going so that wasnt bad at all Communication with the apartment hosts was super easy, they werent in town while we stayed but were still readily available if we need anything Great experience all together

Ella met two of us on the first day and explained how the apartment worked. Pictures are accurate and the apartment is clean and fresh. there is now also summer a fan in the downstairs window which brings in the cool evening air. I came later and had missed the instructions and directly meeting with Ella but she was very accommodating and quickly answered texts and emails. they were out of town so had a very nice stay. Easy access to town less than 5min. and its shops, restaurants and cafes. Very nice location if you are visiting family in the area. Also only short walk to trains and 15min into Boston itself. Enjoyed sitting outside for breakfast and in the evening.

We really enjoyed our stay. The appartment is familyfriendly we spent three days with a one year old baby, very clean and for us it was spacious enough. It was also equipped with everything we needed including kitchen equipment. Ella and Will were great hosts and there was also information in the appartment about what to do in Boston and surroundings. The neighbourhood is nice and there are a lot of restaurants and other shopping  grocery facilities in walking distance. We did not try the public transportation system but a station should also be in walking distance. For a stay with more and  or older kids the appartment can be a bit too small. We would definitely come again and thank Ella and Will for the great stay in Boston.

We had a great time staying in this apartment for our 3 days visit in Boston brThe place is in the basement of a nice Victorian house full of art on top of a hill at 10 min walking distance to the metro and pretty close to the beach.

Jessica was very nice to us the couple of times she visited us at the basement door. I think she tries to have a nice Airbnb, however there are some flaws.  The basement apartment is extremely damp, making it very uncomfortable.  Its sad when your kitchen paper towels, toilet paper and bath towels are already wet before you get to use them. There is an infestation of silverfish, which we are praying we did not bring home with us. She needs to warn elderlydisabled people that the walk from the train station to her place is doable, but it includes two extremely steep hills.  We felt safe in the neighborhood, despite a drunk banging on the doorwindow and yelling a couple of nights.  Lastly, prospective lodgers need to be aware that this is a basement with only one window to look out of and the patio furniture is so filthy its not like the picture where you would feel comfortable lounging.  Im sorry my review isnt very positive, but if I was a prospective lodger I would want to know the truth before wasting my hard earned money.

Jessicas place is a lovely little guest home about 1520 minutes from the downtown Boston area. Although there is not a parking lot, parking is pretty accessible in the area we arrived and parked on a Saturday night. The private entrance is easy to access and in general, there is a lot of privacy in that area of the residence. This location is also close to the train station which can be taken to downtown Boston as well if Uber andor driving is not an option. The host was very sweet and had various types of tea and coffee in the home for use. I would recommend bringing food and there are plenty of things to cookwarm up food with. The space is comfortable enough for two adultsreally wouldnt stretch it more than that unless there are small children with you. This is also a very quiet areaeven on a Saturday night so if youre looking to have a party or loud staythis is not the place for you.

Truly a lovely street and unbeatable neighborhood You need not walk far to enjoy some of the best that Boston has to offer, including the very convenient T, which will take you to farther reaches. My sons and I stayed for a couple of nights, and we couldnt have asked for a better home base for our visit. The studio has nice decor and was just as portrayed in the pictures and description. And while it was no issue for us at all, we would add one note for anyone with impaired mobility To reach the studio, which is on the basement level, you need to descend just a few external stairs. The additional information upon booking was clear and complete, so we exchanged only minimal email communication with Christopher. On arrival, we found the housekeeping service had not set out the air mattress, but it was quickly and easily resolved in a brief phone call, which Christopher answered immediately. We appreciated the newly renovated bathroomtwo shower heads, what a luxurythe modern and wellequipped kitchen, and the high quality linens. We were very grateful for the air conditioning on the hot July days and nights we were there. Plus it was nice to unwind while watching movies on Netflix.

This was a disappointing stay. It was in a very good location, but the apartment itself was small and dark. The bed wasnt a real bedrather a bed that folded out from the wall its the white cupboard in the main picture, and was not particularly comfortable.

When we looked in the closet for another towel, it was filled with dirty linens and clothes. The netflix also didnt work. The rest of the amenities were fine, but it definitely wasnt worth more than 200.

This was the first time Ive left a rental midway through a trip. I left and paid MORE to stay in a hotel. I wish I would have seen the most recent review at the time I booked this place the review posted very recently and I book a couple months ago, because I never would have booked the stay.brbrEverything in the previous review by Gang is 100 percent accurate. Bare in mind this language barrier, hes speaking to the sounds the heater made rather than the AC. The heater made incredibly loud and awful sounds all night long. While Im grateful it was turned on, I couldnt sleep at all because of the rattling and shrieking coming from the baseboard unit right next to the bed and in the nearby kitchen. brbrAlso, the lighting is completely off in the photos provided. The space is very dark. Additionally, there was salt from the recent snow tracked through the entire place and a bag of dirty laundry by the door. I was very uncomfortable with the idea that someonea company was coming by to pick up this dirty laundry while I was there. I ended up carrying all of my luggage with me to a conference because I had no idea who had the keypad code to this place.brbrThe bed is terribly uncomfortable and, for the current temperatures of 10 degrees at night, there is insufficient bedding available. Youre told specifically in the host instructions not to take any additionally bedding from the closet... despite the THIN comforter provided. The bed is no better than a pullout couch with a metal bar in your back.brbrI was so uncomfortable and unhappy with this listing, I stayed one night and left the next day for a hotel. I paid TWICE because I didnt want to stay there.

Walking distance to shops, restaurants, Copley Plaza, Public Gardens etc..brThe apartment itself has had a very recent update including rain shower, granite counters, stainless appliances and more. We loved it. Private entrance leading right out to the street which made things very easy when checking in and getting around. Thats the good. Next, the bad brWhen we arrived there was a bag of linens sitting outside the door. We thought maybe the cleaners were running late and we were about 15 mins early for checkin so we waited to see if they might show up. It was hot so after a few mins, we entered the apartment to find the bed not made, dirty sheets from the previous visitor. Towels left on the floor outside the bathroom. Trash in all receptacles. More towels inside the bathroom. Dishes in the sink. Gross.brWe ended up changing the bed ourselves, restocking the bathroom.

This was a little frustrating since we expected better hospitality.br This place is very small, but you can tell that from the pictures and that is to be expected in Boston.br Bugs  we did encounter quite a few bugs inside the apartment.

In fact, he coordinated a dropoff of an iron we needed badly right when we asked for it. Thank you, Ryan The apartment is located in an exquisitely beautiful area with excellent access to everything one might be seeking. We were there for a conference at the Hynes Conv Center and we walked there and around the city every day. The apartment itself is small and would really be best for a max of two people. But we made it work despite the tight quarters. The kitchen and bathroom are great  top notch renovations. There is a large TV, a Murphy bed, an inflatable queensized mattress, a nightstand, a coffee table, two bar stools and another small table available for use. The entrance is very private and the key pad used to lock the door is a genius idea. It made the checkincheckout process a breeze and not having to worry about keys was great.

This is a very welllocated but tiny studio in Back Bay. It was tidy and the appliances seemed new, but I would caution light sleepers that the apartment is a bit noisy  the head of the bed is pretty close to the fridge, which makes a lot of noise, and the heat system is also very noisy. If you are used to a studio, youll be fine  its really no different than the noise in most hotel rooms. This is a basement apartment so doesnt get that much light, but it is on one of the nicest streets in Back Bay.

Great location on a beautiful, quiet street.  If youre only planning on sleeping here, as we were, youll be good although it was stifling hot at times and the temp. couldnt be adjusted. However, the apartment wasnt nicely furnished, and could have used a small sofa and coffee table  only had 2 mismatched chairs in the small entry area  and the bathroom was extremely small.  Very dark, also, in that it was below ground.

Christopher was great at getting back to us and accommodating small changes we needed to make, like moving the time we could drop off our bags and check out. The apartment was fantastic for our purposes  we were in Boston for a few days to explore and just needed a place to park our luggage and sleep at night. The street outside is charming and quiet and the location is about as good as you can get in the city. It was close to many restaurants and shops and only a short walk to Copley Square. brThe apartment suited us, it got a bit warm at night so we made use of the air conditioning fan in the wardrobe.

The place is cute and quaint. Its the perfect size apartment  to drop your bags and get a good nights sleep. The location was in the center of everything you would want to do in Boston. A short walk to the Back Bay or even Boston Common. The only two things that were downsides about the apartment were that when you walked down the stairs to the front door there were swarms of flies. Most likely due to the warm weather Also the shower was very slow to drain, so if you take a shower longer than 5 minutes be careful not to let the water overflow the basin. Otherwise I would stay here again

The location is good, which is near to the Newbury Street. Overall it is good. We only stayed for one night so the house is just enough for us. The bathroom is a little bit small, and the showers was clogged. One thing that really annoying is that one delivery guy knocked the door with large noise, and  then break into the house while we were still sleeping he know the code to enter the house. He dropped a baggage with towels which we did not request. That is really scaring.

My sister and I landed in town around 130AM we got to the property after 2AM. We tried the lock state pin several times and it did not work. We contacted he host numerous of times and he did not respond until an hour later by that time we walked 2 miles to the nearest hotel because we were stuck without a place to stay. Long story short if you are from out of town make sure you have a back up plan. Christophers communication was unpleasant and he was unprofessional to our experience.

I will start with what is right about Christophers place. It is the Location. It could not be better. Back Bay in Boston is the place to be and his apartment is right in the heart of it Sadly the good does not outweigh the bad. First of all...Commuincation with Christopher is horrible. We were given insructions on how to get into the apartment...using a keypad lock. When we Website hidden by Airbnb didnt work. We tried multiple times. Having the same kind of lock at home, I knew the battaries were dead. We stood there for some time wondering what we would do. My wife looked under a flower pot thankfully and there was a hidden key. I texted Christopher about the situationa and asked what to do a check out. He did not respond for multiple days. I reached out the night before we left to check again...he finally got back to me. It took him 3 days to get back to me. Had we not found the key, we would have had to rent a hotel room as he didnt get back to us until our last night. There are multiple isses with the condition of the apartment. There is a lot of water damage to the ceiling and walls in the kitchen. Paint is bubbling and pealing. Lots of evidence of water damage. Part of the kitchen ceiling is so bad the drywall is hanging down. The water damage appears to have leaked down onto the shelves were food and plates and glasses are stored. Black stains on on the ceiling in the sitting area. I am not sure what the stain was. It looked like smoke damage or mold that someone tried wash away. There is a curtain covering the door windows so people from the street can not see in. The curtain is very dirty. Additionally, the curtain rod is so bent the curtain will not close all the way. The window AC does not fit properly. There are sizeable gaps between the window and the AC unit...you can see outside from the inside. We had to use some tape we found to try to seal it up to prevent bugs and rodants from getting in. Overall the apartment was not very clean. Lots of dirty on the window seal by the AC unit. Walls and heat vents very dirty every where. Walls in general not as clean as they should be. I wish I could attach the pictures I took as it was pretty bad. The apartment lacked needed supplies even for a weekend get away. We were there 4 nights. We had 1 hand towel for the bathroom, 3 bathtowles for 2 people, no kitchen towel or dishrag for dishes. We had to wash out coffee cups etc. with a paper towel. We did not cook any meals there but from what I saw...there were very limited supples. We went to make taost in the morning and there wasnt even a toaster. Again the location...

Catherine was a great host and the apartment is incredible The apartment is very spacious and has a large kitchen, a spacious master bed and a very comfortable 2nd bedroom. Its a very classy accommodation and is well maintained.  It also has an amazing grand piano that is over 100 years old, which Catherine graciously allows guests to use. This was a real treat for me as a musician. The building is also very classic Boston style architecture which really makes you feel part of the city.brbrCatherine was an extremely responsive host as well. My wife her mother and boyfriend and I made inquiries the day of travel to Boston and Catherine was quickly responsive and very accommodating, especially under short notice and with our late arrival.brbrAnd on an additional note, she does have a boa constrictor named Yggy. This might turn some away but Yggy is very low impact, is enclosed in a secure terrarium that is in a separate room. It is something that might make one reluctant but she is very unobtrusive and more importantly very docile and  rather interesting to watch.brbrI have nothing but positive words for our stay in a great apartment with a great and very communicative and accommodating host. I hope to be back

I was tempted to stop at both places because they looked so good and quite a few people were in line.

Having stayed in numerous Airbnbs this is the definition of a great airbnb. Its affordable, spotlessly clean, very comfortable and exactly what you want to come home to after a long day in a big city. brbrThis is a newly finished space with a good sized kitchen, living room and double size bed all in the same space. You will not feel cramped in this space with 2 people. 4 people would still have enough space but youre all sharing one big open area. Having a small fridge, induction cooktop, dishwasher and large sink makes saving on breakfast and snacks a breeze. The bathroom is a good size, very clean and the shower is excellent with lots of pressure. The apartment sized washer and dryer was a bonus. brbrYou are located on a quiet side street with light traffic. Its a short walk to stores and groceries. We walked about 10 minutes to get on the train. It was about a 15 minute uber ride into the centre of downtown Boston.brbrYou access the apartment by climbing about 10 stairs, down 4 and another 2 just inside the door. Keep this in mind if you have mobility issues.brbrThe hosts were very nice people and excellent to deal with.

This was a very short notice booking, which Xerxes graciously accommodated. His contact leading upto and during the visit was always immediate, which is appreciated. Being a first time visitor to Boston, the location immediately behind the statehouse was very convenient to all the attractions. The apartment itself was lovely, as seen in the listing photos.

The apartment was exactly as the online photos depicted. Very comfortable with plenty of room, plus a complete kitchen with all the amenities. We were visiting our son who is a student in the area and my wife was thrilled to be able to prepare a home cooked meal for him. And we just loved staying in Beacon Hill.  Very convenient location, with a short walk to either the Park Street or Bowdoin which directly connects to the airport T stops. Theres a convenience store at the end of the block and a Whole Foods market and liquor store another block away. Xerxes was very friendly, helpful with suggestions and especially accommodating with our need for flexible checkincheckout times. We loved our stay here and would definitely stay here again.

Im not sure I could add any more to what has been said in previous reviews. The Beacon Hill luxury apartment is great and now Im afraid it has spoiled our family and set a very high bar for other AirBNB places. My preteen and I enjoyed  the apartment its comfort, location and convenience. It was such a treat to be in a nicesized apartment that is in walking distance to T stops, good restaurants, the Whole Foods, Boston Commons and the Freedom  Trail. Also, I loved the rain shower head Xeres is a responsive and courteous host who will go out of his  way to get you what you need thank you again Xeres for offering to FedEx  wash clothes to the apartment and Olga is patient and kind thank you again Olga for meeting us later at the apartment so that we can grab something to eat after our very long flight. If our family had to change anything, it would be the upstairs neighbors we live in a house so were not accustomed to people living above us and tighten some screws  on the bed frame it squeaks a little, but those are minor things. We would definitely stay at the Beacon Hill apartment again.

We were very happy staying at Xerxes place in Beacon Hill.  The apartment was located in a tiny street across from Suffolk University and down from the Mass State House.  Being across from the university was not an issue at all  the street is very quiet and not busy.  The apt was very nice  comfortable furniture and bed, fully stocked kitchen, and beautiful bathroom large tub and separate large shower.  We were originally planning on staying in Back Bay but we are so glad we stayed in this location as it was within walking district of Boston Commons and the Public Gardens, Charles River, Quincy Hall and the start of the Freedom Trail.  The apt is also close to the Park metro station which was very convenient.  We would stay here again and we highly recommend this place.

Everything about this place is absolutely perfect Its right in the middle of everything you could want to do in Boston, yet its nice and quiet.

Unfortunately, I had a very bad experience at this apartment. I was excited to visit Boston and stay in this great location, but as soon as I arrived, I realized the apartment clearly had not been cleaned. There were bags of trash all over the kitchen, making the entire apartment smell like garbage. There were pots and pans covering the countertop that had been left unclean. In the bathroom, there was toilet paper scattered in the floor.  All of the towels had been used and left on the floor. There was toothpaste all over the sink and a used toothbrush on the side of the sink. In the bedroom, the sheets had clearly just been used. I tried to  have Airbnb reach out to the host and have still not heard back. I had to leave and find a last minute hotel.
facilities negative
Everything was great, the apartment is very well located and with a fully equipped kitchen and super clean bathroom. The only thing that subtracted from the experience was the fact that there were construction works including Saturdays from 7 am on the street in front of the building and it was very noisy and added to that the AC in the unit was very loud too adding to the already loud street noises.

This place was a delight to stay in, after a fairly horrible trip til this point flights delayed by 2h causing us to miss a connecting flight, delaying us 24h in total without our bags, it was nice that shortly after we arrived a gentleman checked in with us as they noticed the water temperature had dropped ALL of us where going for showers one after another now we finally had our clothes etc back.brbrWe did have a couple of issues with hot water, however they where always available to quickly provide tips on how to get it working, we where rather awkward to work with as we where very rarely in the property as we where visiting PAX East, so it was hard for them to arrange someone to come and take a look. We did figure out how to reset the boiler ourselves on the last day of the stay also, its not the easiest to do so I can understand why they wanted to send someone rather than trying to give instructions brbrIt was a clean, spacious place, quiet once upstairs had been told to turn their music down by the owners D.brbrA couple of minor issues with the WiFi, ones that dont affect operation but we thought needed to be reported to the owners, I wont elaborate here due to their nature, but its nothing to worry about, only we wouldve ever noticed because its our work brbrOverall, happy with the stay, very good value for money and nice to deal with.

This Airbnb is in an excellent location for an amazing price We had a great experience except for a few minor issues. One thing that we noticed was a lack of cleanliness in the linens the mattress cover as terribly stained, all of the carpets were stained, the pillow cases did not seem to be washed, the duvet did not have a cover, and the kitchen towels and hot pads had food residue on them. The fridge had some rotten food and there was what appeared to be mildew or grime in the bathroom.

The house itself was about 40 minutes from central Boston, one bus and train. The bus stop is about 1 minute walk, drops you at the subway station no problem.

Mohamed is the best host one could ask for. He was so polite, respectful, and hospitable. When I first arrived, he helped me bring my heavy luggage up into the room, and gave me a quick tour of the place. After I settled in, he described the neighborhood to me, which is very quiet and safe, and helped me navigate the city. He knows the bus schedule inside and out, he can answer all your questions. The bathrooms are very clean, and he has a new washer in the basement. Oh and the basement is awesome. Very cozy with a nice tv and lots of channels, especially if you are big soccer fan. And he also recently got a WiFi amplifier for the house. So, the place is fantastic. In addition, there are a couple restaurants that are 1minute walking distance if you want a quick bite, and there are many more about a 15minute walk away at the Roslindale Square, really good Italian food and bakery shops. Mohamed is just a great guy. Hes very friendly, has lots of good stories, and knows Boston like no one else. Hes always sharing his fruits and little snacks. And hes a great cook One night, I was waiting for a taxi to come pick me up to go to South Station, but it was running really late. Mohamed, without hesitation, jumped into his car and was ready to give me a ride all the way to South Station. Fortunately, the taxi finally came. But this is the kind of host you want. Someone that will look after you, and is a good person. With all of this said, I HIGHLY recommend renting this place. You will not be disappointed.

When I migrated to the US alone, Mohameds was the first placed I stayed in. And I am glad I made that choice. He is a genuinely kind person and an absolute gentleman.

The entire home is open to the guests which I had spent more time relaxing in the garden. I would highly recommend his place yo anyone considering.

Hes a very friendly host and made me feel right at home  in fact we ended up chatting for well over an hour after arrival.brbrThe unit is most certainly not well represented by the photos  as is the case with many images on ABNB, they just dont do the place justice  The unit is spacious and well decorated, with a wellapportioned kitchen, should you want to get your Gordon Ramsay on.  The bedroom is tucked away downstairs and is quiet.  If youre looking to get some good sleep with a minimum of the typical distraction of a city cars, subways, etc. you will get that here.brbrThe location is as everyone says within short 15m walk to the LongwoodHMS area  just dont forget your umbrella as I did and suffer a late night rain shower.  The subway is less than a 6 minute walk and you can easily connect to the commuter line should you need to get a little further out into the adjacent communities without  a car.  If youre looking for a late night coffee or tea, try JP Licks  a straight shot toward HMS.  There are other restaurants and bars, but in general the area is pretty quiet and low key after dark.brbrOverall, this unit is a great value for someone looking to spend some time in Bostonbr

My boyfriend and I were just looking for a place to sleep while we were in Boston. We looked at a bunch of different places and decided on Alexs based on the reviews we read. We were prepared to be staying in a potentially bad neighborhood based on what people had said, but it really wasnt that bad. It was really close to the T, and about a 10 Uber ride into the city. We didnt walk around the neighborhood or anything, we went into the city each day we were there.brbrOne thing we didnt expect, which wasnt a big deal, was that the bathroom and bedroom were in the basement. It was clear that some type of water system was in the walls of the bedroom, because you could hear noises throughout the daynight. brbrAlex was very responsive when we needed more toilet paper after we checked in. He lives in the same building, so that was a comfort to know ifwhen we needed anything. brbrThe house manual was clear on any type of instructions we needed. I would recommend Alexs place to anyone that needs a place to sleep while theyre in Boston.

Alex has a lovely place. Very clean and updated. He also was very responsive to any questions. We had a problem with the downstairs being a good 10 degrees colder than the upstairs. We worked it out. Also, the AC fan units are downstairs and pretty loud. They were probably working overtime because of the extraordinary heat when we were there. It was very nice to have a cool place to stay after running around in the heat all day.

The apartment was perfect for our 2night stay in the Boston area.  Alex our host was responsive to all queries and messages and we were able to access the home a bit earlier than our scheduled time, and with no difficulty code.  It was well located for us to get around the city by car since we had different errands to deal with for college movein weekend, and we like being away from some of the more crowded neighborhoods.  The T is very close so easy to get around if not driving.  Street parking plentiful, no issues.  Recommend hanging out in Jamaica Plain for dining and breakfast new cafe Little Dipper is excellent. Beds were comfortable and the space is tidy, clean and updated.  Better for 2 people than 34, since the pullout bed takes up the main room and limited space for luggage storage on the main level.  If we had more time there we would have used the kitchen more, as it was well equipped.  The back deck was a nice option to have an alternative sitting area we had nice weather.  Note the only bathroom is located on the lower level where the bedroom is subgarden so you need to navigate a stairway to access. We recommend Alexs apartment and look forward to staying again when we come back to Boston for a short visit.

The photos really dont do this home justice brI stayed in Boston over the weekend and this house is just perfect I came to the city alone to visit friends and needed a place that was close to everything but safe and this house hits all of my key pointsbrLocation this house is located in an up and coming area in Boston easily accessible to the MBTA bus and train. The parking was not a problem. I parked on the Main Street,  it did have parking restrictions but they were for weekdays. brComfort My concern was that the house was going to be dark because of the photos, and reading prior reviews about the bedroom being downstairs freaked me out, because I would be staying alone I worried that it may be creepy. When I arrived I was so relieved to see how bright and cozy this home felt. The kitchen is a dream I only got to cook eggs but the kitchen is equipped to handle anything.the bedroom is downstairs but its very warm and inviting. The shower was a lil tricky i had to reread the you manual lol, and u have to wait a minute for the water to get hot but all and all it was fine.brSleeping the bedroom being downstairs cuts out all noise the house being on a quite street also helps  The Bed was firm and the pillows were plush, I slept GREAT Extra pillows in the closets if u sleep like me with 6 pillows in your regular home. brIf your coming into Boston and actually want to stay IN Boston but want to avoid costly hotels, If you dont want share a house with strangers and need something spacious but cozy. This is your spot I will definitely come back here and I highly recommended it

I stayed in Nicolos house with 2 of my colleagues over a week while we attended an exhibition. The house was a pleasure to stay in and is absolutely unique in terms of dcor and style. The house was clean and while Nicolo wasnt available during the stay there was a great deal of information provided to us, both in terms of the house and the surrounding area. The house was clean and well equipped with modern appliances. The front door operates on an electronic security system and doesnt require keys which is absolutely perfect if youre staying with people who you might not always be with. The Charlestown area was picturesque and quiet, though there was a number of small restaurants and stores within walking distance. We walked about during the evening and felt safe. We also had no problem getting a cab using the company recommended by Nicolo and were in downtown Boston within 10 minutes.

Nicolo was a great host  he always responded promptly to our requests, and gave us a detailed welcome guide that had answers to everything we could have asked.brbrThe location of the house is ideal, it was a quick walk to the TD Garden and the North End, as well as the Navy Yard.

Nicolo contacted me two days prior to arrival to give me details about the property. The house was easy to find, located within walking distance of some small pubs, places to find food and a grocery store. It sits back enough from the street that there is no noise from the very busy street next to it. The house was clean, beds comfortable, linens clean and numerous decorations throughout the house. The inside and outside are fairly depicted in the online posting. There were plenty of clean towels and the bathrooms each had one small liquid soap container. The kitchen had everything needed to cook and plenty of dishes. This is a charming older home but with a regal atmosphere. I would recommend it as well as stay here again.

This beautiful old home in Charlestown was a wonderful place to stay Our friends and colleagues filled out the rest of the home, and they all agreed. Charlestown is a beautiful neighborhood, and a quiet respite from the bustle of the city, while still being close enough to access the downtown area quickly. Still, we spent many an hour relaxing on the front patio, enjoying the evenings and view of the Charles Bridge.brbrThe house itself is clean and inviting. The beds are particularly comfortable, and the kitchen was easily spacious enough for the six of us.brbrOverall, this is a highly recommended property When we return to Boston, we hope to stay againbrbr

We had a great vacation in this beautiful, historic home. As stated in other reviews, the location was ideal. We were a 5 minute walk from the Freedom Trail, 15 minutes from the Italian restaurants in the North End, and 25 minutes from the aquarium. The neighborhood was safe and very charmingclose to public transportation, groceries, pubs and historic restaurants. The house was very comfortable for a family of five our teens and preteen were happy to be able to spread out, not share beds and have TVs in their rooms. We were also very appreciative of the attentive housekeeper who helped with a minor alarm problem and had the house immaculately prepared for us.  Nicolo was wonderful to work with. He responded quickly to all of our questions, provided a lot of information about the neighborhood, including restaurant recommendations and maps to everything of interest. He made the trip very easy for us.

Upon arriving at the house we were surprised how close we were to a major road but were quickly relieved when we found it really wasnt intrusive at all. It was easy to get to anywhere from this location via public transport. In addition we were able to stock up on food at a nearby supermarket. Location, house, cleanliness were all spot on although the bathrooms can be rather small. Nicolo was a very good host and provided a Welcome Guide that was very helpful. He always responded promptly to any questions I had and everything went very smoothly while we were there. If you love antiques and old houses this is a perfect place to stay.

This is a beautiful, well equipped house in a nice, quiet area in Charleston, on the Freedom Trail.brbrThe kitchen was well set up with lots of non perishable food items in the cupboards. There were two large double rooms which were very comfortable, each with their own en suite bathrooms. The top room had two single beds and would probably be better for children as it is quite small for two adults. The property is very convenient for getting in to town and particularly convenient for us as we were walking to the TDGarden everyday for the World Figure Skating Championships. The taxi to town is between 8 to 15 dollars and 25 to the airport.brbrCharlestown is a very pretty and quiet neighbourhood with a small supermarket quite nearby.brbrNicolo was in regular contact with us by email when we had a question and was very helpful to us on our leaving day, allowing us to stay longer because of an evening flight.

Nice place, and a nice refurbishment of the old house.  Not too far a walk from the downtown area of Bunker Hill, and not bad to drive to once you figured out how to get in and out of all the Boston one way streets. Quiet neighborhood for the most part. Individual rooms were nice and the beds were decent. All the amenities were there and the kitchen was well appointed. In the hottest days of the summer, the first floor was hard to keep cool, but the bedrooms were comfortable for sleeping.

Fantastic location and spacious house.  We had been to Boston a number of times before but never for an extended stay.  The house was perfectly located for walking the Freedom Trail and North End and rarely ever more than a 1520 minute drive to everywhere else.   Nicolo was a super responsive host and we really never needed anything from her since the house and everything in it was as advertised.   brbrThe parking space is very tight but we managed to fit a Dodge Caravan doable but goes right to the line in every direction.brbrLast tip the house gets to be on the noisy side at night which is to be expected given its age creaky sounds and proximity to 2 major bridges traffic sounds.  Were pretty light sleepers so some white noise machines were a must for us.

If you appreciate the beauty and nuances of historical homes  this is the house for you.  We thoroughly enjoyed the experience of this home and it served as the perfect home base for our group of 6.  The home is a mix of 200 year old architecturelayout with many modern conveniences, and the location in Charlestown could not have been better.  The window unit ACs were more than adequate it was in the high 80s outside and everything else within the home worked as advertised.  The parking space is small, but it worked fine for our Chrysler 300 large sedan.

We really enjoyed our trip to Boston. The house provided a great location to walk along the freedom trail and explore the north end. The off street parking was so, so nice Otherwise parking would have been much more stressful We have a four door pickup and were able to back into the spot  you definitely want an expert driver for parking. The house is definitely historic and quirky  the architecture was lovely. But with the uneven floors and three flights of stairs, Id be hesitant to stay here with little ones. The front of the house was being repainted and it looked great by the time we left and the painters were done. We were disappointed that the kitchen was messy dirty dishes in the dishwasher and a disconnected stereo among other things on the counter. In addition to the repainting on the outside, I think the bathrooms and kitchen could use some updating  there was mold and rust in the bathrooms. Despite these details, we still enjoyed our time and this location. We would highly recommend the bakeries in the north end and eating at the Warren Tavern, all of which were close to this historic home

I lived in Nicolos amazing Charlestown townhouse for a month this past June and July. I had such a wonderful time and felt completely at home  I felt like I was truly living in Boston. I traveled to Boston with my mother and my children ages 4 and 9. Charlestown was the perfect location for us, and Im so glad we didnt stay in the city proper. There was a very neighborhood feel  we could walk to two parks within five minutes. Also within 510 minutes were Whole Foods, CVS, the Warren Tavern which was more like 3 minutes away  we ate there often and I do believe they have the best clam chowder, Starbucks, a local wineliquor store, Legal Oysteria, Bunker Hill, the USS Constitution, and more.brbrBoston proper is an easy walk over the Charlestown bridge. Both of my children handled the walk easily and we enjoyed the proximity to the Freedom Trail. Boston truly is a walking city and we walked almost everywhere When we got tired we would Uber 815 dollars for everywhere we wanted to go or take the T 2.90 a person, kids are free, easy 510 minute walk from Community College station on the orange line.brbrWe ate many dinners in the North End because it was so close and easily accessible. For us, anything under a mile was very doable, and we walked to the North End often.brbrThe house itself exceeded my expectations, and I had pretty high expectations after seeing the pictures. The living room and generously sized kitchen are on the first floor. There is a laundry room in the basement with Samsung devices that were easy to use and efficient. The second floor holds the master and the queen bedroom. Nice mattresses, plenty of pillows, and more pillowscovers are stored in the armoire in the queen bedroom. My mother and I enjoyed having our own bathrooms. The water pressure was AMAZING and you dont always get that with older homes. My children stayed on the third floor in the two twin beds. I initially worried about them navigating the stairs, but neither of them had any trouble. They had their own bathroom as well, which was great. Ronney, who helps out with the property, was very responsive to our questions and addressed any concerns we had.brbrHaving our own parking spot was wonderful in a big city like Boston. We used the car to take many day trips, including Gloucester, MA, Newport, RI, Salem, MA, Ogunquit, ME, Portsmouth, NH, and Plymouth, MA all under two hours away. However, we didnt use the car a single time we were doing anything in the greater Boston area, and it was nice to have a guaranteed spot. Yes, its a tight spot, but I was surprised at how quickly I learned to squeeze our Toyota Camry inbrbrIf I were to live in Boston, I would want to live in this neighborhood. Its very family oriented, lots of young professionals and children, and very quiet. Im back home in my much smaller town and miss Nicolos place already

So, I had to come to Boston, as thats where my company meets.   Normally, I would stay at the W Boston, but it was completely booked, and other hotel rates were simply insane 400 per night.  brbrWith little time to spare,  I came to my trusty friend AirBNB, looked for something closeish to the W, and found this wonderful little apartment.  You know how sometimes the pictures are taken under the best possible conditions, and dont really represent the place youre going to get   Not so here  The apartment is tastefully decorated, with a very nice little kitchen, good lighting, and a comfortable bed.  The bathroom is smaller, but the shower itself is really nice.  I didnt have a chance to use the jacuzzi tub, but if I were to have spent even one more day, I would have filled that bad boy right up and soaked away my stress.brbrWireless connectivity was great, the hosts were marvelously accommodating dealing with a particularly late arrival, compounded by a delayed flight.   The location is really great, the apartment is quiet and conveniently located, and the local restaurants are quite nice.   brbrI particularly appreciated the little touches like robes in the closet, and slippers for my feet.  I come from a noshoes household, so, I really appreciated the thought they put into that.   Having menus and such for local restaurants was nice.  There was milk for me in the fridge and coffee easily available I drank the milk, but not the coffee.   .brbrA stay.  Im not ever going back to the W unless this place is booked.

A convenient MBTA stop by the river, and Boston Commons a few blocks the other direction. One day I took a nice walk through the Commons and down Newbury Street  totally delightful. Once back at the cozy and quiet apartment, youve got a big jacuzzi bathtub waiting for you, a solid internet connection, an extremely comfortable bed, soft cotton robes to lounge in, a Keurig coffee maker w plenty of tea and coffee pods, chilled water bottles in the fridge, and even some apples and little snack packs of baked goldfish crackers.

Paul was a great and communicative host. Picking up the keys was easy and the apartment itself was clean and inviting. Most of all, the location is incredible. My friends and I felt like we were a 1520 minute walk away from everything we wanted to see or explore. The kitchen was well stocked and the water was always hot  an important feature when you visit in December This place is great for exploring the city and Id highly recommend anyone stay here.

Paul makes you very comfortable in this lovely apartment, with every convenience available.  It is so central that you can walk everywhere and its under 10 minutes walk in a lovely neighbourhood and across the common to the subway system.  Paul was in touch when we needed him and came over to clear the 12 of snow away from the front door and sidewalk for us.  It was lovely to be able to come back after a cold snowy walk and relax in warmth and comfort and cook ourselves a meal.  Thank you Paul

Paul is exceedingly responsive and has a beautiful condo in a perfect location in Beacon Hill and for all things Boston  We walked everywhereto the Commons, Newbury Street, JP Licks, and more The condo is outfitted with everything youll need for a great stay and is immaculate. The pull out sofa is actually comfortable unlike most We hope to be back soon. Thanks, Paul

Perfect location to see all the historic sites of Boston.  Its walking distance to most of them.  Pauls place was very clean and comfortable.  The communication to get the key was easy and accurate.

There was bottled water and snacks and the kitchen was stocked with coffee and tea. The furnishings were lovely. I slept on the hideaway queen sofa and it was more comfortable than any hotel bed My friend slept on the queen bed in the bedroom and said it was very comfortable.The bathroom was well stocked with soaps, lotions, shampoos, and bathrobes.

Unfortunately, Winter Storm Grayson made it impossible for my husband and I to make a trip to Boston our flights were cancelled, so we never got to stay in Pauls place. However, I am still leaving Paul a great review as a host, as he was very courteous and prompt to respond to any question I had during the booking process. We are so disappointed not to get to stay in his place this time, but will look for it first if we ever get to make plans to return to Boston.

We stayed at Pauls place with 4 adults. In my opinion, this space is better suited for 2 people and maybe 12 smaller kids. The apartment is just too small  uncomfortable for 4 adults. Both the master bedroom and living room have very comfortable beds. The master bedroom was pretty warm with the hot temperatures in Boston when we went in late August. There is an AC unit in the living room that keeps the living room comfortable but we had to sleep in the master with the door opened  no covers because it was very warm. Pauls place is convenient to the MBTA Blue  Red line. Its not too far from Boston Common if you can make it up the steep hill There is very little room for storage in the apartment, particularly if youd like to unpack your belongings. The bathtub was really slippery, not sure if the cleaning solution used made it so but a tub matgrip is needed.

Even though we were late arriving, we were warmly greeted by Scott and daughter Emily. The home is a charming 19th century city home carefully restored. There are beautiful oil paintings and drawings on the wall. Ask about the story about the lady in the chair at the top of the stairs. The bedroom was very roomy, the bed a comfortable queen size and a separate sitting room and private bath. For us the best part of Airbnb is meeting our hosts and enjoying their hospitality. Scott and Emily were joyful attentive hosts. We loved spending two nights with them. brPat and Joe Kelly

This Airbnb was exactly what we were looking for . I was bringing my daughter to Boston just to sightsee for a couple of days and we didnt want to break the bank. This warm cozy inviting home was extremely close to the T which got us anywhere we wanted to go. What I LOVED about this place was that we got our whole own little area with very large and comfotable bedroom, own full bathroom with awesome shower, and even a little sitting area with tv. Not what you usually find with Airbnb and all at a very good value. PLUS they kept the breakfast in Airbnb by serving us homemade granola, fruit, yogurt and raisin toast each morning. The hosts were extremely easy to communicate with before hand and had the perfect blend of friendliness and do your own thing while staying there. Perfect stayhighly recommended.

The place was like a hostel, with shared bathrooms and kitchen. You have to make a self checkin and checkout, so you dont get to know May. The house was clean, one of the beds in our room was a little bit uncomfortable but for the res it was OK.

Great value for Boston, it is perfect if you dont want to spend a lot, I would stay there again.

The place is exactly as described. Its not the Hilton, but its in a convenient spot. The neighborhood is decent, and if you know your subways, you can get to and from the airport without an Uber, Taxi or Lyft. Buy a Charlie ticket and take the Blue Line to Orient Heights stop. I got a couple groceries to store in the fridge to hold me between treat meals. May was kind enough to let me store my bags in the basement before my flight so I could explore more weightlessly  the stairs are a bit steep to the basement, but it was worth it. brbrThere was slight confusion on my room number, but May got back to me lightning fast. It was a simple number mix up, no problem. I do recommend this place and will stay again

Mays place is great for a lay over. Easy check in process.

This is a great location about 5 minutes walking to the T station. Lots of great places to eat within walking distance. 2 T stops away from the airport.  super close to the aquarium and Quincy market, about 15 minutes on the T. brbrI stayed here with my kids. On one of the days, it rained.  There isnt really a living room or common area except for the kitchen. With that said, we werent willing to stay crammed in a room all day while it rained. I probably wouldnt stay here again with kids... it felt restrictive staying in a bedroom the entire time and it is a hostel style establishment so I felt bad every time my kid screamed. I would definitely stay without the kids. brbrAnother con to staying here is that it is a hostel style home. There are 23 ppl in a room and there are 3 or 4 rooms with only 2 bathrooms. You do the math
facilities negative
This is definitely a good value deal if you are traveling with multiple people and just need a place to crash.  You share bathrooms and showers with multiple tenants, so it kind of feels like a hostel environment. The room we stayed in had a very awkward layout, with three beds packed in a small room with extra furniture in random places. It was quiet and decently clean, but simple. Not really a place to hang out at, just a place to put your head on the pillow and shower to get ready. If thats what youre looking for, rates are decent and its right by the T at Orient Heights for easy access to the city

Communication with Liesl was great, she responded extremely quickly and was very helpful.  The apartment is ok.  Being on the ground floor was perfect for my motherinlaw as there were no steps to navigate.  The downside being that as this is more of a basement apartment its dark and unfortunately a little smelly in the communal area.  Theres no aircon in the living areakitchen and this meant even with the provided fan, this area was horribly hot. There also was no information about parking either on the description or in the house manual which was a big shame as we were ticketed on the first night.

The house is about 5 minutes walk from Stoney Brook T station. The fare to Central Boston is 2.75, and a weekly ticket at 19 is a bargain for longer stays. Get it on your first journey.

Evelyn was welcoming and accommodated my late arrival.  The room is at the top of the house with a door that closes at the bottom of the stairway, so you feel that you are in your own apartment.  The room is large and the private bath is enormous.  The bed is comfortable and fresh towels are provided.brbrIt is situated 5 minutes from public transportation and the neighborhood is calm.  Highly recommended.brbrOne caveat the door frames are 6 3 high and the roof in the bedroom is sloped.  Im 6 4 so I just needed to remember to duck when moving between the room and bathroom.

As a repeat visitor to Evelyns wellpriced room, I can wholeheartedly recommend this listing to anyone considering a stay in Boston.  Even though its not in the heart of downtown, its only a quick subway ride to the heart of Boston.

Evelyn was a GREAT host, and her home, and the room we stayed in, was beautiful and comfortable. It felt like a home away from home. She made every effort to make our stay in the city enjoyable, and provided useful information about getting around, as well as a tasty bite to eat to get us on our way in the mornings. The neighbourhood was safe and, while not in the centre of the city, was very accessible to the transit system 2 blocks away that would get you there in 1015mins. I would certainly recommend a stay with Evelyn.

Evelyns house was absolutely perfect Just a 5 minute walk to the T to downtown Boston. Which was perfect for us on our roadtrip, as we could safely leave our car at hers. The room is beautiful and huge Because youve got the whole top floor it feels like youve got your own apartment. Evelyn is a lovely host, with good suggestions of areas to visit, and she provides a delicious breakfast It was like a home from home. Thank you Evelyn.

Staying with Evelyn was wonderful My husband and I really needed a quiet place to get away and Evelyns home was perfect. Evelyn was very knowledgeable about the area and recommended some great restaurants for us to try. Her neighborhood is really nice and only a short walk to the subway. Our room was amazing The room itself is on the third floor and it has a large private bathroom. The bed was large and very comfortable. Evelyn gave us a key to the front door so we could come and go as we pleased. Evelyn also has the cutest dog named Kobe who greeted us every time we came home and she was so kind to lay out a healthy breakfast for us each morning. I would not hesitate to stay with Evelyn again. We came back rested from our vacation and plan on visiting again.

We had a great stay in JP at Evelyns lovely home. She was very hospitable. Her home was very convenient with access to the T and local shopsrestaurants. The heat was up in Boston during the week of our stay, but the AC window units kept our part of the house very cool and comfortable. The wifi was efficient for my daughters need to netflix. Parking was easy at Evelyns, and we only used the car on two occasions when we decided to drive to a nearby restaurant in JP. The area seemed very safe and secure.  We walked to and from the subway each morning and afternoon without concerns. Thank you, Evelyn, for making our first time in Boston a great one. We will definitely be back.

Evelyn is a wonderful lady who took very good care of us.  She made us feel very welcome has a beautiful home.  Our room was great and was very private with our own bathroom.  The rooms were very clean and the bed was super comfortable. I had no problems sleeping at all haha.  Evelyn is a great host and had everything we needed including maps and brochures of the city plus breakfast every morning which was a pleasant surprise.  Her place is close to the subway station and is a 10 min ride to the city.  Theres many restaurants in the area to check out plus its close to the Samuel Adams brewery.  We loved our stay with Evelyn and we loved her adorable dog Coby.  We would definitely stay with her again.  Thanks you Evelyn for having us.

What a great space This place is huge First of all, pictures dont do this place justice. This is a massive home with a gorgeous kitchen. You have the third floor all to yourself with a very large bedroom and a huge PRIVATE BATHROOM. For those of you who dont like to rent rooms in a tiny apartment, youre in luck... it isnt anything like that It truly was like having your own hotel room.   brbrEvelyn was lovely. She let us in and gave us some great pointers and things to do around Boston. She also had an amazing little breakfast spread for us each morning that was ready when we got up. The kitchen is lovely and the home is so large that we never heard her. She was so friendly and has an awesome small dog hypoallergenic and doesnt shed named Kobi. He was there to greet us in the morning and when we came home at night with a tail that wouldnt stop wagging.brbrDont let the location scare you. It is literally a 2 minute walk to the train station and then a 10 minute train into Boston. It was SO SIMPLE and the trains come every couple minutes. We enjoyed downtown, back bay, etc... and were glad to be home so quickly afterwards.brbrBoston was a surprisingly awesome city and we had a wonderful time at Evelyns place Thanks again

Evelyn provided a wonderful stay for us We stayed at Evelyns home on the third floor with spacious clean and private bathroom for a week and we enjoyed every day. She gave us a tour of the home and showed us our private third floor, which was separated by the rest of the floors with its own door. Since the floor was private, we didnt feel like we bothered Evelyn when we listened to music, came home late, or watched TV. The room is larger than the pictured and the bed is very comfy. The bathroom was the cleanest and largest bathroom closer to the size of an entire room Ive ever used. The shower was perfect and it was so nice to use the clean robes  sheets provided for us by Evelyn. Everyday Evelyn had breakfast ingredients out on the counter so we could help ourselves to a sitdown breakfast with bagelsenglish muffins, fruits, and juicecoffeetea. We used Uber most of the time to go to the Prudential 1520 min drive and used the mbta once which was only a 5 minute walk from the house. I would definitely come back to visit Evelyn and her wonderful dog Kobe who greeted us every night we came home.

I highly recommend staying at Evelyns if you plan on visiting Boston. This was our first visit and Evelyn welcomed us into her character filled home and made us feel very comfortable. Our room was amazing, much larger than portrayed in the pictures and the bathroom was huge, we had our own private suite, awesome Evelyn left breakfast for us each morning, cereal, juice, yogurt, muffins, bread for toast and condiments. Her home is only a short few blocks from the orange line train which took us into the city in no time and was very easy to navigate. I cannot recommend Evelyns home enough, you wont be disappointed.

If you are attending a conference at the BCEC and missed the hotel cutoff like we did, dont worry  book Tiffanys The place was great and was about a 15minute walk to the BCEC.

Inside, the decor is modern, it was sparkling clean and the towels  pillows were plentiful Everything you could need is right there and had there been time, we would have sat outside on the back porch.

Tiffanys place was perfect for what our family needed. Plenty of room for our large group. Bedrooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in an urban setting. So it wasnt an issue for us at all.

Tiffanys townhouse is on a lovely and quiet side street in South Boston, aka Southie. The house is a small 3 bedroom duplex with a full kitchen and a back deck. It is very conveniently located, immaculately clean, and very comfortable. Theres a brand new washer and dryer set in case youre coming with kids and the laundry piles up quickly. Very lovely base for exploring Boston, and especially for hitting the restaurants on West Broadway in South Boston. The Boston Seaport is also walking distance, or a very short drive away. Very highly recommended

Tiffany was great, beautiful place and she was great with communication. We were upset though because parking was extremely tough and we ended up having to spend over 50 just to park one night.

Helen is sooooo nice Waking up to Helens SCONES, CROISSANTS, and so much more baked goods is amazing by itself....but the location of JP is awesome and the place is kept up very nice a has all the essentials for a nice stay. Your own entrance and exit in the back of the house hardwood floors, Homemade granola, and did I mention the scones  Helen helps out with food suggestions and parking arrangements right when you get to her home. The subway station is walking distance away from the apartment and is literally a 20 min ride to downtown Boston so its perfect. I also suggest just walking to the shops and restaurants in JP Jamaica Plains, because they have a lot of little thrift stores and coffee shops all over. Sam Adams brewery isnt far either which makes it a sweet deal too brbrThis place is a MUST if you come to Boston

We loved the apartment, it was clean and well equipped with lots of thoughtful little things kept there e.g. salt and oil in the kitchen as well as tea, coffee and fruit. The location is great, just a few minutes walk to the metro or to a street with lots of places to eat. Helen gave us lots of insider advice on things to do, places to eat etc and left a whole bunch of leaflets and guides for us to look at in the apartment. They brought us baked goods from the bakery every morning for breakfast, and even made us croissants the day we left as we left before the bakery opened.

Helens studio apartment is well equipped with everything we needed. It is thoughtfully put together with what a traveler may need but not crowded. We did not cook but everything was there if we wanted to. Helen provided pastries and coffee and cereal and fruit each morning. The bed was super comfortable firm. The bathtub is an old free standing tub with a curtain fully around it,. There were supplies of shampoo, soap etc if needed. Little cupboards and racks to provide room for sundries. It is a short walk to the T subway and about a mile of walking to the local restaurants in the neighborhood. So for us it was a good location and a great experience. Helen  and Stuart are friendly and helpful. Helen even left us a loaner umbrella in the hall advising us of Boston weather. We needed it.brBut I think it should be noted that this unit is in an old house and there are steps to get up to the house from the street and then 3 flights of wood stairs to the unit. That could be difficult for some travelers. It was not a problem for us. We felt right at home and enjoyed our 3 night stay. We would definitely stay there again.

It was our first time visiting Boston and after much research we chose his Airbnb based on the rave reviews and description of the apartment. brbrJonathans apartment was just as described. Very clean, well decorated, quiet and comfortable. Our room was spacious, comfortable and we felt right at home. All the necessities were provided including towels, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, a working air conditioner, water and sweets upon arrival. brbrThere were other guests staying in the additional rooms but we never saw or heard them. As two female travelers we felt safe and had no issues while in the apartment. brbrThe apartment is located in the neighborhood of Roxbury and is about an 8 minute walk to the Roxbury Crossing station. From there you can catch the orange like going inbound to Downtown Crossing and catchy any of the other lines to the various neighborhoodssites you wanna see in Boston. My friend and I didnt explore Roxbury, but it was close to the South End.brbrOverall if you want a clean and comfortable space with a friendly host that checks in and is available if you need him, this is the space for you. Youll need to use the train on a daily basis to get around. Overall I recommend this Airbnb and would stay here again when visiting Boston brbrThanks Jonathan for a friendly and comfortable visit.

Staying in Jonathans house made me feel at home. And another good part was Jonathan is a really nice person and gave me many suggestions about eating and having fun in Boston. I had a great time in Boston. Also the location of the house is good, 8 mins walking to metro station and its easy to take metro to downtown. Ill book Jonathans house again when I go to Boston next time

Jonathans building is truly one of a kind. It is an incredibly spacious, bright and well furnished building with several rooms for his guests. He has done a fantastic job in making the building function perfectly for the guests. If you like to cook there is a spacious kitchen with individually arranged and stored utensils for each guest party. About the room, we stayed in the en suite room which had a large doublesinked bathroom and shower. It was more than enough space for myself and my partner to stay in for the week. The bedroom itself is well furnished, very light and clean, comes with a great cable TV package, extra towels and bedding. This was the first time myself and my partner stayed in a sharedproperty, as longtime AirBnB users we were skeptical about privacy but Jonathans building is large enough that you do not hear others and you do feel as though you have adequate privacy. Staying with additional guests turned out to be really pleasant experience, when we crossed paths with some of the guests we had great conversations and shared stories about Boston Overall, I would highly recommend Jonathans space especially if youre looking for something affordable and with good transport links to the centre of Boston. Thanks so much Jonathan, lovely to meet you

Parking was free and sooo easy, which is much different than what Im used to in Boston. Amazing kitchen with everything you could need The only thing that was a little annoying was the street noise level was a bit high, but it never really kept me up, just was loud for a while then would quiet down.

I very highly recommend this clean, comfortable, and easy private room in Jonathans house The room is neat with a comfy bed, good sheets, a large private bathroom with a great shower head and an inwindow but quiet AC unit for those muggy Boston summers. The surrounding neighborhood is safe and quiet. I stayed here for an interview at Brigham and Womens Hospital and it was really convenient  I walked to and from my interview, even with my suit and shoulder bag. The subway which seems to be able to get you all over Boston including train stations and the airport is very close, less than a 5 minute walk. Communication with Jonathan was great  he is super responsive and helpful. He clearly cares a lot about his house and his Airbnbers Will definitely stay here again if Im traveling in Boston, and I certainly recommend for business travelers or interviewees

BOOK THIS PLACE NOW Seriously, this home is so incredibly lovely, and comfortable. Its incredibly clean, spacious and has an elegant, modern design. Jonathan was communicative, and though I had a really quick trip for work, I felt well taken care of, and very welcome. Id book this place again in a heartbeat upon returning to Boston, and really cant recommend it enough.

Johnathan provided a large bedroom and bathroom that was very clean and quiet.  I did not personally meet him, but he responded very quickly to my questions.  The rail was located about a 5 minute walk away and from there you can get around Boston easily.  There is a wonderful restaurant, Milkweed, walking distance from the room in Mission Hill on Tremont St to dine at.  I recommend his home.

Loved my stay at Jonathans place I was in town for an interview and staying at Jonathans updated brownstone felt much more comfortable than a hotel.

Couldnt be happier. Had a great stay here. Its basically a boutique hotel. So many nice touches. The bathroom and bedroom are large and clean. Quiet nights but he provides earplugs if youre a sensitive sleeper. There was a water boiler in the room with all sorts of coffee and tea along with cups and a bottle opener. An iron was provided as well. He even had robes and slippers Everything was perfect. Ran into the host once and he was very kind. I stayed here for an interview at the Brigham and it was easy to get to. Just keep in mind that whatever Uber quotes you with regards to arrival was almost always 1015 minutes earlier than reality. So plan ahead. Traffic to the airport is also gridlock from 46 so plan well Had a great stay and will certainly return.

We had a great stay in Jonathans brownstone. It was a great location, we walked in to central Boston everyday. The city is very walkable. The house was spotless, we loved all the nice touches like the bathrobes, slippers and chocolates left for us on arrival. I was visiting Boston with my Irish boyfriend and Jonathan even suggested a local bar run by an Irish man which was a nice personal touch.

Jonathans house is a big brownstone house with several private bedrooms and a big kitchen to share. We stayed in the master bedroom which had its own bathroom and a nice little sofa area. The room and the whole house was beautifully refurbished and we had everything we needed. Communication with Jonathan was really easy. Getting into the house was also really easy as it had self checkin. With regards to location it was great as I had meetings at Northeastern University which was about 17 minutes walk away. The nearest T stop to the apartment was Roxbury crossing which was about 6 minutes walk and gets you on the Orange line straight into town.

A great place to get the classic Boston Brownstone experience. The interior is new and modernized with new windows so there is very little noise. The place is very clean and well decorated. I stayed in the Master bedroom which has its own bathroom. The neighborhood is very quaint and there is a square and community garden across the street, and very walkable with the Roxbury T stop only a 5 min away with a moderate uphill grade. Jonathan is very responsive host, and he gave very good instructions on how to check in. The double bed was comfortable but seemed a bit small for a tall person like myself, however I knew this when I booked.

The neighborhood is vibrant and fun.  We had dinner at Stephis which is within walking distance. Saved  on breakfast by stopping by the small convenience store that was right nearby.

The picture looks exactly like the room. I did come with a ton of luggage so if you are catching the subway then you may want to call a cabuberlyft from the Roxbury station. If not, then the walk is not bad at all. There are stairs up to the brownstone as they all have, so to get in the room you will have taken 3 flights of stairs. The great thing was that Jonathan mustve seen me carrying my luggage one by one because he got there when I made it up to the first landing....he came and helped me carry. Note to self pack lighter He also helped me carry when I left. Im from Hawaii so the buildings and neighborhood is so different from my state and I loved walking around. I only stayed for one night, supposed to be two, but my flight changed. I walked to TGI Fridays to eat since the one in Hawaii closed many of years ago. Mmmm tastes exactly like I remembered. This is a cute neighborhood and if you are here to stay in a cute, clean, safe place this is it. Jonathan is very organized and has a place for you to keep your shoes, food, toiletries. He also has some extras for you if you want bananas, milk, beer, shampoo, conditioner, body wash. My room had a shared bathroom. The house was full, but I didnt run into anyone at all.

Lovely little room on a quiet street of a great neighborhood. Checkin couldnt have been easier you just get a code for the door. Dont expect much of a personal touch.

Perfect place to stay if youre visiting the city for an extended period of time or traveling for work.

Alicias flat was great Its small, but it has everything you need. The location is excellent, since its right in the middle of everything.

The room was located on the third floor and could be accessed by staircase . I only mention this because if you have any physical limitations this may not be the place for you. the building itself is very beautiful and I enjoyed walking the spiral staircase every day . it is located in a great area and it was easy to walk anywhere we wanted to go. the hosts got back to very promptly when I had a question. there is no parking here so if you rented a car  which you wont need if staying in the city then account for having to park in a garage. the room had beautiful hard wood floors and an updated bathroom. The room itself is small so if you are expected a huge space you will be in for a surprise. I highly recommend this room if you are coming to the Boston area. It made my trip so easy because of the location. there is a cool little bar called the red hat within a min walk which makes it a nice place to cap the night off and you dont have to go far at the end of the nightbrbrbrbrbrbr

I stayed in Alicias studio app. n8 for 4 nights. The studio is really nice and well furbished as described in the pictures. Toilet papers and towels are provided, together with a soap bar and a small amount of shampoo, tooth paste and mouth wash. No hair drier is available, but an iron and an ironing table.brThe kitchen has a basic amount of things 2 per plates, cutlery and cups, but dish soap and sponge are missing.brThe bed is comfortable, but a little short and small for 2 peoplebrThe studio is located in a very nice neighborhood, 10 min walks or less to T station, a big shopping center and restaurants.brEverything was ok...maybe a little expensive for what is offered, but in the complex it was a nice stay with all the basic confort needed.brThe only very  neg note was the very strict check in time. I contacted Alicia several time in advance since we were arriving early in the morning and it would have been nice to have a place to leave the luggage until the afternoon. Although, even if the studio was not booked the night before, it was not possible to leave the luggage anywhere in the buildingapartment before 4pm due to late booking possibility. She after a couple of emails finally suggested a couple of option to store the luggages.

I loved the building location, and the style  cleanliness of the unit. The building is located about 3 blocks from Prudential Center, near public transit, shops, and tourist spots, in a quiet, safelooking neighborhood.brbrThe unit was comfortably warm, and heats up very quickly if you want it warmer. There were functional windows which allowed for letting in fresh air. In addition to the listed bathroom amenities, there were also toothpaste packets and mouth wash. The bed might be spacious enough for 2 people if they were around 5 and thin and do not move too much. The sofa is a little over 5 long.brbrSome things to be aware of is that there is no onsite staff to enforce the house rules and office hours are from 9am to 10 pm. Also, I came back one day to find the unit unlocked. That was rather disconcerting.brbrThe kitchenette was not as functional as I thought it would be. Useful additions would be sharp knives and a stove that doesnt make the room lights flicker. There are many nearby restaurants though, and a Trader Joes for microwaveable meals. brbrThis is a good place for a shortterm stay as long as you have the good luck of having considerate neighbors or dont care about noise. I was not so lucky. My first night felt like staying in a frat house, with loud voices, thudding music, and a lot of door slamming. Another night, around 2 am, the couple next door decided to spend about an hour taking turns crying out and making weird noises.

The host is amazing with their communications and keeps a super clean room, although the apartment door only locks with a flimsy deadbolt building entry has a separate lock too, which certainly helps, stovetop doesnt work, bed isnt all that comfortable, and its overpriced for what youre getting.

This location is great for a weekend trip to Boston. Especially if youre alone or have a partner. The room is very small. The bathroom is smaller. If youre a larger person this might not be the best option. This is a excellent choice if just need the bare minimum of a bed, toilet and a shower. You wont be entertaining guests or preparing a meal here. They had plates, utensils, bowels etc which is handy. It has a hotel room feel but without concierge service. I can confirm a previous review that the towels did smell musky. Beneath the sheets there were some hairs from past visitors. I give it 3 stars because i was able to get it the night prior and its a great location compared to nearby hotels but its small, and could have more charm. The channels on the TV were very limited so bring a laptop with Netflix.

Everything is great about this place with one big caveat  theyve put the tv cable box in the entry closet so when you want to watch tv from bed, the remote doesnt change channels. To get it to work, you need to either get up and stand in the kitchen, or take the box out of the closet so it sits on the floor. Stupid design, seems completely thoughtlessly put together. A weary traveler should not have to figure out this puzzle to watch some TV at night. Also toilet is very small.

This apartment is very clean and comfy. Although its on the Newbury St, its pretty quiet actually, probably because my room is facing the alley.

I didnt check about it before booking, but luckily I was on the 2nd floor, so it wasnt too bad.

Great location at the heart of Newbury and was sufficient for the price. However, there were a few things that were annoying about the stay. The bed is fairly small for 2 average sized adults and is not the most comfortable, the fridge makes an annoying high pitch humming noise at almost all times, the TV cable box is located in the closet, and no one returned our call when we had difficulty turning on the shower.

Great size, matched the pictures, in a great area, it was easy to get in with the door codes. However, the carpet was wet and the room had an intense mildewmold smell like there is a longstanding leak. It is so strong that it obviously wasnt new and any cleaning or management staff entering the room would be very aware of it. It was really overpowering and it was hard to stay in the room for more than just the night to sleep. The mattress was old and worn and dipped in certain spots.

Corey was a great host. The place was very clean and great location. The back deck was a highlight and a nice place to hangout for some beers
host positive
Corey and Carly are great hosts This Airbnb is their residence, and they definitely make their guests feel at home, leaving both a little welcome basket with snacks and wine plus enough space in their closet for a 45 day stay. They also respond to questions extremely quickly. The Charlestown location is on the far side of the monument from downtown. It is quiet and lovely and puts you in easy walking or Ubering distance of restaurants, tons of Boston attractions, and a Whole Foods and CVS for necessities. We were a bit surprised when they contacted us the day before letting us know of a roof leak that necessitated them putting two large orange  buckets in the hallway outside the bedrooms to catch falling paint chips. While it didnt impair our use of the space, it took away from the charm some, and in correspondence with them, it seems it has been an issue for several weeks or more. This was a bit disappointing for a property at this price point.
service negative
Coreys place is a great location for seeing Boston without being IN Boston.  The Charlestown location is convenient to Bunker Hill a 10 minute walk and even the Navy Yard isnt too far.  Restaurants and convenience stores are nearby as well. The place was very comfortable with a great living room and highend kitchen.  It was quiet and the air conditioning kept the apartment cool even on a sweltering summer afternoon.  On street parking can be a bit of a challenge, but with a little patience it isnt too much of a problem.  Corey was very quick to communicate and to keep us informed.  We loved the nice welcoming bottle of wine and beer that awaited us on our arrival.  Allinall a first class place.  The only downside is that the stairs are a bit narrow and steep which could be a problem for those with mobility issues.  We would stay there again.

The room itself was very clean and unexpectedly spacious for a loft bedroom, even housing a small sofa for which I took advantage of to keep on top of emails at the end of each day. The facilities on offer were exceptional and better than most hotels I have stayed in and I get to travel a lot with work.  Conveniently located just outside of the city center that is accessible via public transport, personally though it is a very pleasant walk too 30 mins. Jonathan even provided local information on local amenities and places to eat etc and his recommended pizza place penguin pizza did not disappoint. Exceptional value for money and would recommend without hesitation.

Jonathan is the ideal airbnb host. Communicative, kind, considerate, genuinely caring. This place was heavenly to stay at. A truly nice home that is well tended to. Jonathans roommate is wonderful as well and his neighbor across the street invited me over for a BBQ. Would highly recommend staying here.

Jonathans place is absolutely amazing From checkin to checkout, everything is clear, organized and seamless. Jonathan had a personal handwritten note on the table of the room to greet every one of his guests. The room is tastefully decorated, super clean, has tons of little amenities that hotels dont even provide bath robe, water, beer, etc.. I mean I could go on and on. If youre in the Boston area, this is the place to stay at The neighborhood is really nice and quiet and super close to downtown. I cant recommend staying here enough

Why book a night at a 5star hotel when you can stay at Jonathans Brownstone Its the perfect place to stay when traveling to Boston. A quick walk to the T Orange Line, and in a lovely quiet neighborhood. Everything is immaculately clean, with plenty of storage for your things, and a very comfortable bed. Comfy bathrobes, plush towels, and a hot water kettle and private fridge are just a few of the little details that make this place an excellent stay. Jonathan was very responsive and everything was perfect. Highly recommended

Fabulous host, cant do too much to be helpful and welcoming. Immaculate attic room, shared bathroom and lounge with free bottle of lager in the fridge to welcome newcomers. Area felt safe and was well positioned for Museum of Fine Arts and Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Interesting eateries 510 minutes walk. Use of kitchen with fresh fruit provided. Attic is 3 flights up from entrance, and has air conditioning. Ceiling is a little low above the bed as you would expect. Very tasteful decoration, beautiful cotton sheets and comfortable bed. Jonathan lives just down the road and calls in regularly.

Jonathan goes above and beyond to make your stay at his place wonderful. I was only in town for one night and I was trying to decide if I should just spend a little more money on a hotel or book an Air bnb. Im so glad I did because honestly this place was better than a hotel. I got a personal note for Jonathan, chocolate, a cold beer in the fridge, and fruit for the morning. I would highly recommend staying here

I loved this cozy, clean space. Jonathan was a great host from the communication prior to my arrival to meeting me there and showing me around the house. My room and the common areas had all the things I needed for a comfortable stay. The neighborhood was quiet and quaint in close proximity to public transport. Would definitely recommend

The rooms in this house are rented fulltime, so it feels somewhat like a regular BB.  I didnt meet Jonathan in person, but the one message he sent me had all of the information I needed.  My room was clean and spacious at least in the horizontal directions, with plenty of room for my stuff in the dresser, on the desk, and on the bedside tables.  It was thoughtfully equipped with a jug of water, a towel and washcloth, a bunch of maps even a beer in the fridge.  Best of all, the mattress was very comfortable firm.  The neighborhood is pretty, though there is very little commercial stuff in the immediate vicinity.  Of course Boston is pretty small, and you can walk anywhere.

I had a great stay at Jonathans place. It is conveniently located a little walk from the subway station. The best part, however, is the place itself. Jonathan has clearly spent a lot of effort making the apartment very nice. The kitchen is large and modern, the living room stylish. There were many thoughtful touches to my room drinking water, a plan of the surrounding, a handwritten note. It was overall a wonderful stay and one of the best airbnb experiences that I have had.

Location was great about 10 min fr the nearest Subway but do note there are some slopes to reach the place. There is no elevator in the house so u gotta lug ur luggage up the stairs which are quite steep. I stayed in the loft bedroom so that was quite a workout. The loft ceiling was low at the edges  so i knocked myself a few times before getting used to it. Maybe put a sign low headroom or sth will be helpful. Aircon was very noisy they provided ear plugs which wad helpful but still not ideal when ure trying to sleep. However on days when i was tired i didnt notice the sound. Probably not too suitable if u are a light sleeper. Do note there are no real doors they are all curtains with velcro closure. But i didnt feel unsafe anything so that was ok. Really appreciated the laundry and dryer and detergent powder provided. Kitchen was large and nice. Living area super comfortable. Nice parks around as well if u wanna jog around.

It was a great stay. I was at the room in the loft and it was so cozy for my personal space. The host, Jonathan left a note of welcome on the table. The AC was a little too noisy but there were complementary ear plugs available on the bed desk.

Spotless place. I was in the loft room which didnt have a door and is connected to the open space in the house  it meant that I could hear people talking when they didnt close their doors as well as when they used the kitchen. It didnt bother me too much as I used ear plugs, but if you want to work I would suggest to book one the other rooms on Jonathans listing. All on all I had a very pleasant stay.

I stayed here for 3 days when I came into town for a concert and to see some friends, and I stayed in the loft bedroom. The townhome was beautiful and very clean. You can tell he takes pride in his space and guest experience. Checkin instructions were very clear and detailed, which is much appreciated. In the loft, it can get kind of noisy since there isnt an actual door and there are other guests, but nothing crazy and unbearable. I didnt find myself losing sleep or being annoyed by it at all, but if that would bother you I would recommend getting some earplugs to sleep. If you ever find yourself in Boston needing a place to stay, I highly recommend staying with Jonathan.

This was my second time staying at Jonathans place, and it was just as great the second time as it was the first. Its clean, beautiful, and the location is amazing. Its about a 10 minute walk to Roxbury Crossing Station where you can hop on the T and get everywhere relatively easily. Its also super walkable and the neighborhood is quiet. There are a couple of museums nearby, and Target is a 30 minute walk away. If you need suggestions on where to go or where to eat, Jonathan leaves recommendations on the desk inside the room. The other guests in the house are very respectful and you can expect a reasonable amount of noise during the day, but nothing bothersome or unbearable.

What an absolutely perfect place to stay when in Boston  It was conveniently located near everything and the studio itself was fantastic.

As other reviews mentioned, this place is all about the details....from water in a carafe and chocolates waiting for us at our arrival, to large bottles of shampoo and body wash in the shower, to city maps and food recommendations printed out for us to take.  Jonathan was a fantastic host  he was very welcoming and checked in several times to ensure our stay was going well.  We came into town for the Boston Marathon....he texted us several times wishing us luck and asking postrace how it went.  He went above and beyond and we plan to stay here again when we head back to Boston.

I had a great stay at Jonathans apartment. To begin, Jonathan gave very clear instructions as to how to get access to the apartment and what his expectations were while I stayed there.

We had a perfectly cost stay at the brownstone. It was only one night, but exactly the safe, clean, and comfortable kind of place we were looking for. Jonathan provides those nice, welcoming touches snacks that make you feel at home. The neighborhood is steeped in unique history, if you have time to explore during your stay. great location for getting to all areas of Boston and the highways out of town. Its an efficiency, so the space is small, but we were only there overnight so it was fine for us. Only negative is that the bathroom sink is painful small, making it difficult to get in there to wash your facebrush your teeth. Water inevitably gets onto the hardwood floors below so even though we wiped it, it will inevitably lead to water damage. Overall, a really nice place to stay for a quick trip to town.

We had a great twonight stay at Jonathans studio. Jonathan provided all the information we needed to check in well in advance of our stay. The studio was easy to find by car using the GPS on our phone and we were able to park right outside the front of the property for the entire stay. From reading previous reviews we knew the space was small and cosy but we were pleasantly surprised by the clever use of space. Our main concern had been where we would keep our large suitcases for easy access this stay was part of a 2week road trip, but as the suitcases open in half we were able to slide them under the bed when opened up. The studio was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning came in handy with the hot weather. Tea, coffee and creamer cartons were provided, and Jonathan also left us a bottle of beer each in the fridge and a couple of miniature chocolates. The only very minor issue we had was that the windows arent particularly sound proofed so any noise outside was heard quite clearly inside the studio. Fortunately the area is very quiet so we were only disturbed momentarily on a couple of occasions at night and very early in the morning. All in all this stay was very good value for money and we would highly recommend to others to stay here. Thanks Jonathan

A wonderful place to stay in Boston. The room is neat and clean, decorated in white color makes people feel relaxed. The bed is comfortable too, my girlfriend and I both had wonderful sleep every night. Not too far from the subway station, a little slope to walk and might feel a little bit out of business area, if you dont like noisy place, this is a perfect spot. Convenient to get food when exit from subway station, overall its a nice and lovely living neighborhood. If I go to Boston again, this place will definitely on my list to live again.

very small space, but very well thought out and comfortable. located in a quiet, residential area with only a five minute walk to public transit and 1520 walk to a variety of restaurants. never met jonathan, but he is very responsive to textemail and was kind enough to leave some beer in the fridge and dining recommendations for my short stay.

Jonathans place is awesome. It is super clean, bright, and comfortable. It is definitely a small studio, but so well laid out that you dont feel it at all. brThe location is great too. About 10 minute walk to the T orange line. Close to many things, but not in the middle of the craziness of the city.brThis is the second time I stayed there and would totally do it again.

Jonathan communicated clearly and frequently, which really helped me to feel confident I had booked a good place and didnt need to worry about any mishaps like I have with other airBnBs.  The space was so well utilized too  Even though it was so small, I felt very comfortable.  It had all the bare necessities.  The space was a bit loud, but he provided ear plugs that allowed me to fall asleep I go to bed early, like 9pm anyway   So thoughtful.  Definitely recommend.  Great value for a location so close to the orange line.

The location fantastic and is very close to the train station, about a 510 min walk and your on the Orange line. Tremont St. has a lot of nice little restaurants if you want something before heading into downtown. My wife and I enjoyed our stay, but I want future renters to know that the space is very small and tight in every way. While the pictures are somewhat accurate, realize that the front door opens directly into a small foyer where it can be difficult to get inout with bags or luggage. Also the bathroom is about as small as I would compare to an airplane, the shower allows just enough room to turn while standing up. We brought our dog with us and that made things even feel tighter. There just isnt  a lot of space to stow things or hang stuff up to keep out of the way when your trying to move around. I will say that Jonathan was very communicative and the space was very cleantidy. Free parking is also a huge plus, Id say this is a good safe space for two people that just need a spot to sleepshower etc.

A great location but as four middle aged professionals it was fortunate that we were fit enough to negotiate the 3 flights of stairs with our luggage.

This apartment is wonderful and I would definitely recommend staying here It was clean, quiet, comfortable, and in the best location possible. I was really pleasantly surprised at how quiet the apartment is, considering how close it is to a bustling neighborhood. The bedrooms are very small and only one bedroom has a closet, but the space as a whole was fine for two couples. The AC made a huge difference in the humid Boston weather.

Drors place was stylish and cozy. The decor and amenities are like a boutique hotel  nothing dated or worn. Like he says in his profile, the apartment is 100 years old, and small, but we liked that. The kitchen and bathrooms were excellent. The beds were comfy and we had everything we needed for a great stay. Dror called to make sure we arrived and helped us find our way when we got lost. Thanks, Dror He also recommended a super close place for dinner  La Summa  which we walked into off the street and had a fantastic meal. And we are foodies. The location puts the North End at your doorstep, so you feel part of the neighborhood. Everything inside and outside of the apartment is within arms reach. Thats what it feels like.

My wife, cat, and I spent from early June  early August in Drors Hanover apartment. Over the course of the two months, we really enjoyed Boston, and felt lucky to live in such a unique and fun location. Drors place is nested on the historic Hanover street, with plenty of sights and restaurants right off your door step. Dror and his staff were always  very quick to resolve any issues and helped make sure we were comfortable. A few things to mention that we felt were important laundry is available in the building awesome, the chairssofas are aesthetic and nice but not very comfortable, the king sized bed is nice but there is little other room in that bedroom. Further, if you want to do some serious cooking in this kitchen, do be advised that for baking there is only one small baking sheet, otherwise everything was stocked and helpful. We would stay here again, but especially recommend it for anyone who wants to see the sights of Boston for  1 week.

The apartment was lovely. Although its a basement apartment, there is still plenty of light in the living room. The apartment is quite big and has plenty of room for visitors. Most amazingly is the location. This apartment is a very close walk to the main part of Fenway, Kenmore Square, and Newbury Street. Its also right across from the Fens, which is a lovely place for a walk if you need some fresh air. I highly recommend this place. It is comfortable, convenient, and you will definitely be taken care of.

Our host was very welcoming and provided insider tips for nearby restaurants, grocery store,and sight seeing attractions.  Our host was very prompt to reply when we needed to contact him. Property was as listed, and very close to Fenway  It is an older property, but roomy enough and comfortable for 4 adults. Kitchen is a small efficiency kitchen with no dinning room., but there are two couches in the living room to sit on while eating. The Parking in the city as in other cities is difficult and because this property is close to Fenway, it is expensive on game days.

The location is great, especially if you plan to go to a ballgame or concert at Fenway  it is literally right around the corner. It is also right across the street from victory gardens, which is a nice area to walk through. If you are a day sleeper, youll want ear plugs. There is a service hall adjacent to the appt and during the day there is activity in there  lots of doors closing. It can get loud sometimes. We did sleep well, the beds were comfortable.  This is a basement appt, which is really nice for luggage. There were lots of places to put your clothes, load up on groceries, it almost made me feel like a local. It did not have a breakfast table, but you should be out enjoying Boston, right It was about 12 mile from three different train stops, which is really nice for getting around the city. I do recommend this location, it is a nice spot for getting around and is a good clean place to stay. The hosts did a great job with communication.

We didnt know Boston geography well prior to booking Alans place, but have to say it is perfectly placed.

Great, great stay.

Eddie met my husband and son at the apartment when they arrived. He gave them a quick tour and shared info on surrounding area. The apartment was basically as shown in pictures and description except there was no tv in the bedroom. Unfortunately I made the reservation so my husband did not know there was supposed to be a tv and  only found out shortly before their trip was over. Once Alan was alerted to no tv in the bedroom he promptly tried to remedy the situation. The apt is very basic, very small kitchen, no table and chairs but tray tables to eat on.  Dave and Travis spent very little time at the apt so this did not matter to them. Bed and sofa sleeper were clean and comfortable. Kitchen is small but had everything they needed to make breakfast and a few meals. Any questions the guys had, Eddie was very quick to respond. The area was perfect. The guys were there to watch the Red Sox play and it was a 5 minute walk to Fenway Park. There are many good restaurants, coffee shops, bars, Target, Star Market and the subway all within a 510 minute walk. The guys walked several times to downtown Boston in under an hour. There is also a nice park across the street. The guys both said they would stay at this apt again. Nothing fancy, just a clean, comfortable, nice apt in an excellent location. Thank you Eddie and Alan.

This apartment is in the perfect location for anyone looking to stay near Fenway Park and Boston University. The apartment is almost exactly how it looks in the pictures and was great for a weekend trip to Boston. The hosts were absolutely amazing, accommodating, and easy to communicate with. They were super helpful and made our arrival and departure seamless. As much as I am grateful for this apartment, I do have a couple negatives, unfortunately. The mattress seemed very old and you roll to the middle when laying in it, which can be uncomfortable for two people to be in the bed at once. Also, there is a lot of noise all night. It sounded like the entrance to the building had a big door that slammed every few minutes. I am not sure where the noise was coming from exactly, but once you fall asleep it is not so bad. This would only be a problem if you are a light sleeper. Both negatives do not outweigh the positives and I would definitely suggest giving it a chance. I would recommend this apartment, especially if youre looking for a great location with great customer service

Loved the location. Parking was 20 for the night down the street which was a little sketchy as they only accepted cash, gave no receipt, and no tag for your car. There was a group of people outside the front door offering free fortune readings upon arrival. They were there into the early morning hours which was strange but not the hosts fault at all...just weird. Furniture left a little to be desired. Couch was a little scuffed up but the pullout was super comfortable. The dining room table consisted of a folding table and folding chairs. No issues with the noise complaints mentioned in other reviews. The stove wasnt working but there was a hot plate there. No ice made in the freezer was a bummer after a long drive and a strong thirst but not the end of the world. For our purposes place to crash after a night out it was totally great.

We loved our stay at Alan and Eddies place, and although I never got the chance to meet Alan, Eddie was very accommodating and helpful with checkin. We did hear the many noises this apartment has to offer that other reviewers mentioned, but going into it expecting these noises made it bearable. What was a small surprise was when we entered the apartment to it being uncomfortably hot, seemingly 85 degrees, and no control of a thermostat. After cracking some windows it cooled down, but it was a challenge to try and maintain a comfortable temperature within the apartment during out stay I fully understand that this is out of our hosts control and instead that of the apartment complex. The location was truly wonderful with many restaurants, bars, cafes, etc. within walking distance this really enhanced our trip. Overall, I would certainly stay at this place again, certainly worth the small imperfections.

Home was not as advertised.  Firstly it is at 1173 Boylston, not 1195 as advertised.  It is a basement apartment. The apartment was dirty overall   Baseboards, corners, and windowsills had visible grunge, cobwebs in most corners.  There was dustdirthair on the floor.  The couch and love seat cushions are peeling and have lost much of the pleather finish nothing like the pictures.  The shower stall caulking and grout show mold and grime. Stove did not work.  Bed had a pronounced valley that made it uncomfortable for two. Overall impression was a dorm room that was used hard and cleaned poorly. We voiced our concerns to our host about the general conditions and he refunded the cleaning fee.  I still would not book this rental again unless some of the issues were addressed.

Communication with Eddie Alans associate was flawless and checkin was super easy. Apartment was not exactly as it seems in the photos, it is a basement unit that can be quite darksmoky smelling in the living area and the couches are very worn not as they look in photos. The bed was actually broken in the center so the mattress sloped down and is very noisy. The noise from nearby apartments and the elevator in the building is extremely loud at times as well. However, the location is perfect and we couldnt beat the price in comparison to the nearby hotels A few upgrades as far as furniture is concerned could make all the difference.

Bad experience, gross and subpar. Originally booked a different place with this host, and they made us switch to this place because they said the one we originally booked is unavailable. Maybe thats how they get people to stay here. They give the wrong address 1195 in the listing it is actually 1173 a basement.  The bedroom was the worst. Mattress makes noise with any movement and is caved in in the middle. Roaches crawling all over the bed, walls, and my luggage. Constant loud knocks and noises throughout the day and night. Old furniture.  Finally, the check out is at 11am, but at 8 in the morning someone knocked once, then came inside, telling me I had to leave or they would throw out my stuff soon. Only plus about this place is the location, but I would never stay here again.

Overall this place was a complete mess, dirty, loud, in a basement of a conservatory, on a busy street, and I did not feel safe. They had me go into a random place and go into the microwave to retrieve the keys for the apartment. The bed was disgusting so I had to put a towel over the bed and then ended up not even sleeping my whole stay because I was mortified. I ended up leaving early because I couldnt stand be in this apartment any longer. The description tells you otherwise. DO NOT STAY HERE. THEY OVERCHARGE AND IT IS NOT WORTH IT. THE DESCRIPTION AHOULD BE UPDATED. THIS PLACE IS A COMPELTE DUMP.

The checkin process was seamless. Alan gave good instructions, and responded promptly with communications. The location is excellent, by a park, near the subway, groceries, and cafes. When I got to the apartment, I was surprised to see small roaches wandering around on the kitchen bench top. The furniture looks weary. There is a round glass table, where I could eat or work on, with a few threelegged stools. However, the stools felt wobbly, and I almost fell off a few times. What Alan should have pointed out in the description is that, this apartment is on the basement level  which, by itself, is not an issue per se. The biggest issue I had was the noises coming from the pipes, throughout the day and night. Every time someone upstairs in the building flushes the toilet, I can hear the water gushing in the pipes, and the sewage coming down another pipe, because all these pipes are exposed right below the ceiling. Sometimes the pipes make a vibrationclanking sound as well a water pump. This is particularly difficult for me, because the pipe noises arise through the night, which meant that I woke up every hour or so, or every time someone uses the toiletbathroomshower. You can also hear the elevator noises and loud footstep noises from the stairwell inside the building. The bed makes a rather loud squeaky sound every time you move slightly. I saw that other people also made very similar review comments about these pipe and bed noises. One of the pillow cases has a 1 inch tear. Overall, the location was great.

I want to start by saying that this is a really great location to be at everything is within distance and very convenient within itself. But nothing beats the hospitality and comfort of the hosts. They treat you as if you stayed at one of listings for months or a regular and customer service like that should be recognized and make it a recommendation for anyone. It is quiet enough to study during the day and close enough to two gas stations to grab a quick snack

Amazing Italian food within minutes. We loved My Cousins Place for bagel breakfasts, it was a 35 minute walk. brbrBiggest Con its a very small studio Im from the south so this is very small for my standards so it can get cramped, especially for two people. Its not a place to quarantine long hours for as you need some type of fresh air. Also not suitable for a feast or big dinner as theres not much kitchen space or oven to cook much in. brbrAll in all, we loved this spot as the hosts were impeccable. Id deff come back for a short stay but not for long as again, it can get cramped with a lot of belongings.

We stayed at Tricias house for a month in the summer. Our stay was excellent. We are a family of 4 with two little ones and Tricia had all sorts of little things to make us feel at home  bubble bath in the bathroom, kids toys in the closet, kid specific books on Boston, extra diapers. We hosted a number of our friends and family in the rental, including a dinner party for 15. The balcony is breezy, the AC works even on the third floor, and the kitchen, bed and bathrooms are spacious. Tricia made herself available for help and suggestions, was always friendly and ready to offer a hand. An incredibly kind and gracious host.  Just a few things to consider  the rental is on the second and third floor of a house, so if stairs are a problem, this may not be the right place. Also, the offstreet parking is down a slight hill and with a narrow drive. Our rearview cam came in mighty handy and I recommend it to those who are less than confident backing up a hill.

We had a very nice stay for our July 4th getaway. This house was so close to the Forest Hills Tstop and it made making trips into the heart of the city very easy. It was very clean and had plenty of space for four adults and a toddler. The beds were pretty comfortable as well. Unfortunately for us we happened to be staying during a week that the temperatures were the hottest theyve been in something like 100 years and only having air conditioning in 3 of the bedrooms was a little problematic, but thats more our bad luck than anything, but just know if its abnormally warm outside the house is going to get hot. The back porch was lovely to be able to sit out of in the morning and evening. Many cups of coffee were enjoyed while sitting outside. The only real issue we had was that we didnt know how many staircases were in the house and we were traveling with a one and a half year old who would have gladly run down them and did try to when we first got there. Luckily she didnt go up the stairs to the third floor, but we had to use the bench in the hall and her pack and play to block both sides. It might be useful to have a couple of baby gates available. Had we known we would have brought our own, but we made it work. Just be cautioned if you are traveling with little ones you may need some means by which to prevent them from taking the stairs on either side of the landing. Tricia was a lovely host and when the hot water tank was having trouble on our last night she even offered to let us stay an extra night to make up for it. We might have taken her up on it if we didnt need to get back for work. Aside from a few minor things we had a lovely time and we would recommend this house for your stay.

This apartment is spacious and clean. Tricia is a welcoming host, even providing breakfast food for the first morning. The neighborhood is full of large old homes, and the T and the Harvard Arboretum are 2 blocks away. The only caution would be if you have trouble with stairs since it is on the second and third floors and the stairs are a little steep.

This was a really great Airbnb It is about a 20 min drive from the Prudential Center area of Boston. The place itself is really spacious and Tricia is a wonderful host The area around the home is quiet, cute, and feels safe. Do want to note that the second bathroom is located within the master bedroom, so if youre traveling with a larger group, just something to keep in mind I would also say that a couple of the beds are very stiff. This wasnt a major issue for us in particular, but just also something to keep in mind depending on the group that youre traveling with. Tricia also leaves a list of recommended restaurantsplaces to visit, which comes in handy, too. Thanks for the great stay

The apartment is spacious and the roommates have generally been great. The room itself is newly renovated and very comfortable. As for the area, my expectations were low, but its tough to find an affordable place with offstreet parking in this city. Ive lived in Boston for three years and was advised to stay away from this relative area. Im happy to say it didnt live up to its reputation. Its not Back Bay, but its not the crimeridden area i was led to believe it was. I think it had problems in the past but its not that way anymore. Just leave the occasional ratchet person alone and theyll leave you be as well. Outside of that, its the closest Ive ever lived to a grocery store, Marshalls, and a YMCA. Those were huge benefits to me.

Great place for our bachelorette weekend get away This AirBnb had everything we needed and it was honestly better than i expected. 7 women with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom seemed like it was going to be tight.

And the deck was a great feature Our host was also very attentive when we had questions and messaged us to make sure we had everything we needed more than once. There was also plenty of street parking, which was great, because it took us a while to get Ubers to the area. Its not in the heart of Boston, but the East Boston area is definitely up and coming.

Staying at Lucys duplex marathon weekend was a nice change from a standard hotel.  The Beacon Hill location was ideal  The previous two years, I stayed at the Marriott Long Wharf during the marathon.  I found Lucys Beacon Hill location was better, due to the proximity to Boston Commons, North End,  and the finish line at Copley.  There is also a Whole Foods within a few blocks.  We appreciated the quaint and quiet street.  The townhouse is very well suited for 3  4 people.  Both bedrooms had very comfortable queen beds.  If youre a light sleeper, I recommend bringing ear plugs. or sleeping in the master bedroom.  I slept in the master bedroom, which was quiet.  But my cousin was kept awake in the other bedroom from the loud banging noises from the heating pipes.  However, my sister slept in there one night with ear plugs and didnt hear a thing.  Lucy advised me in advance about the pipe noise.  So we were not surprised at all.  It just comes with the history of an old building.  I can understand, since I own a vintage condo in Chicago that was built in 1929.  We didnt watch much TV over the weekend, but a few times we would have liked to tune into ESPN, CNN, etc.  There seemed to be just basic channels, and premium movie channels, like HBO.  But no other cable channels.  It didnt negatively affect our stay, but it might for guests who are big TV watchers.  Thanks Lucy for a wonderful stay in Boston

Fantastic location for a base in Boston for a family of 4.  Wellequipped condo, very close to Whole Foods for shopping and the Transit station to let you get around the city easily although walking around Downtown and the Common is very easy.  Lots of close local restaurants  Zen for sushi, Tip Tap Tavern literally at the end of the street for great beer and pub food  and a good location to stretch your legs along the Common or the shoreline.  We all had a really great week and were glad that we chose Lucys apartment.

Overall everything was good The apartment is as pictured. The kitchen is well stocked for cooking and both beds are quite comfortable. Lucy was very responsive and easy to communicate with. The street is pretty quiet, too. brbrA couple of things to be aware of the pipes are pretty noisy in the second bedroom. If youre there when the heater is in use, we recommend bringing ear plugs and a sound machine app. Also, all toilet paper has to go in the trash cans, none can be flushed. Not a huge deal, just something to know going in. brbrOh, definitely eat at the Tip Tap Room around the corner

Stayed here for 2 months from January  March 2016. This is a nice house in the heart of hyde park. It is close to the high street shops, restaurants and grocery stores. It is also close to transportation. We rented a car during our stay and the driveway was very convenient for our use. The two bedrooms are comfortable and the bathrooms are nice. The kitchen is very well equipped. brbrWe encountered some issues with the house and the host. Barbara was not the greatest host and she was hot and cold depending on the day. She has a very brash tongue and is extremely rude. We gave barbara notice to check out of the house earlier than reserved. We followed airbnb policy online and gave sufficient notice, She refused to follow airbnb policies and issue us a refund. She ignored the request sent online and so Airbnb had to take care of that issue themselves. brWe had issues with rodents in the flat. An exterminator was sent out twice to address the issue. Barbara claimed she has never had rodent issues even though we met a rat trap in the house upon arrival. The rodent issue persisted even after the exterminator came to check the house out. brWe also has issues with the temperature of the house. It was winter and the house was unbearably cold. Barbara has instructions to leave the heat at 68 degrees which is absolutely unbearable even with the space heaters that were provided. It was constantly freezing in the house and we had to wear sweaters and socks and multiple layers all the time. The heat does not work. Especially in the master bedroom bathroom. Absolutely freezing brbrTHE NEIGHBORS.... extremely loud neighbors. We pretty much had a concert going on every friday and saturday. The neighbors would run through the house all day long. We tried speaking to them twice and they basically slammed their door on us and told us to speak to the landlord. Barbara tried to speak with them on multiple occasions with no luck. This was a huge stress on us as we had a newborn and we needed to take naps during the day while he slept. The noise also sometimes startled him. brbrBarbara tried to rip us off. She insisted we check out at 11am when she had no intention of refunding us for unused nights even when we gave her notice as per airbnb regulations. I had to file a complaint to airbnb resolution center. She was a terrible host. She was upset we didnt use her cleaner even though we cleaned the apartment regularly and kept it clean. Also upset that I rearranged the house. Who leaves their stuff in every single cupboard in the house. I simple put all her things in one place in the bathroom. Where was I supposed to put my own things Ridiculous. Worst airbnb experience ever. brbr

Our little group of 5 stayed here for 4 nights while in Boston.  The house is exactly as described here on the site, it looks exactly like the pictures.  Its a very lovely home and quite comfortable.  It was spacious enough for all of us and we liked that it had 2 full bathrooms, as most places for rent in the Boston area only have 1 bathroom.  brbrWe had several college tours scheduled and the location of this home was very convenient.  Only a 20 minute drive into Boston.brbrTheres a little liquor and sandwich deli nearby called Green Garden Liquor and Deli at 35 W. Milton.  Its a little hole in the wall that you probably wouldnt even give a second glance towards but the owner makes the BEST sandwiches  brbrThe hostess was very kind and made sure we felt at home.  Plenty of pillows, comforters, towels and sheets.  We had access to a washing machine and a dryer, which was very convenient.  brbrOverall, a pleasant stay  Thank you, Barbara

I stayed at Barbaras place with my fiance and both sets of our parents, so six adults in all. We had more than enough space for our stay we had a small family reunion with some of our family members in the area and even with around a dozen people, it still was very spacious and great for visiting and hosting The kitchen has a lot of tools, spices, and other appliances to use and we made use out of the grill twice. Barbara also provided some welcome snacks and drinks, which was a nice touch. brbrUnfortunately, there is no central air as is common with a lot of NE homes and it was in the 90s for two of the days we were there, so it was fairly uncomfortable in the living area where my fiance and I were sleeping, but both bedrooms have window AC units and were very comfortable. If you are staying here during the spring, fall, or winter or even most weeks in summer, I dont think you would have this issue  especially if no one is sleeping in the living room.brbrThe only real complaints we had with the AirBNB was that it was not as private as we anticipated. The washerdryer is shared and we had some issues with waiting to wash our clothes as it was being used and then someone left their wet clothes in the washer overnight so we had to wait until late the next day. Additionally, at one point the six of us were sightseeing while my brother who lives in the area was at the AirBNB and Barbara walked into the AirBNB without telling any of us ahead of time or even knocking presumably because our cars were gone and she assumed no one was there. This was a little alarming to all of us as we assumed no one else would be entering or using the space while we were there  certainly not without advance notice. Needless to say, the rest of the time we were there we took great caution to hide our valuables as we did not know who else may have access to the unit.brbrAll in all, it is a lovely home with a very convenient location to the commuter rail and a lot of space and amenities. Barbara was very responsive to advance questions and let us check in early and provided everything we needed for a mostly comfortable trip. However, there were a few things that were a little disconcerting and I do not think we will stay here the next time we visit Boston.

Barbaras place is so nice. Clean, spacious, very well equipped, quirky cool decor and nice little touches of a stocked kitchen and advice on local features. Cant fault the house at all. Around 2030 to get to the centre of Boston in an uber which was great. brThe only issue we encountered, which is not a reflection on Barbara and her hospitality, was a super noisy family that live upstairs. Starting early and continuing until late they were extremely thoughtless in their noise levels despite being asked to keep it down. Hopefully this isnt the norm and we were just unlucky
mood negative
The overall value of the place was good. It was in a quiet, familyfriendly neighborhood and it was quiet. The house was fully furnished. You have the bottom floor with a separate entrance but there are other people in the building. The two drawbacks is that it smelled strongly of pot st night which may be bad if you are traveling for work and the scent gets on your clothes. Also, the temperature varies from normal room temperature during the day to very cold at night. The thermometer on my jacket said it was fifty nine degrees I asked for it to be heated better and the owner stopped by and played with the thermostat and it got warmer but it was just as cold the next night.

Nice local restaurants and really anything you needed nearby.  Dan allowed us to drop luggage before check in and leave luggage after check out which was great  Dan checked with us to make sure we got checked in and out successfully.  He was easy to reach if we had any questions.   All went really well.  The neighborhood felt really safe.  I was glad that we arrived in the day light.  When we returned later that night we thought it would have been tricky to find the unit for the first time in the dark, as it is tucked back on a tiny street that was not super well lighted.  That posed absolutely no problem, just something to be aware of.  I would definitely stay at Dans place again and recommend it highly.

Dans place was a great crash pad for our weekend in Boston and although he was out of town he left clear instructions and was always easy to communicate with. He also kindly let us leave some bags for some extra hours on the day of our checkout which was a huge help. The room is quite cosy but has the bonus of an ensuite bathroom and lockable door which is good for privacy. The bed was comfortable and the area was really cute, and a short walk from the T.

Highly recommend staying here Its a very quiet little area and I really enjoyed being able to stay in a place that more accurately mirrors Boston living than a hotel since my boyfriend and I hope to move here eventually.  Very cute little home with a full kitchen if you should need it, WiFi included, tv in the living room area and in the bedroom. Comfy bed with soft sheets and your own private bathroom. Would be great for a short or extended stay in my opinion. Off a main street with plenty of restaurants and Dan leaves a list of recommendations as well as nearby transit info. About a 10min walk to the T station in what feels like a safe neighborhood, and on the subway you can get anywhere you want in another 15min.

It was a very easy walk to the T Broadway and 3 short stops and you were at Boston Common.

John is very welcoming and flexible. The location is easy to access from the T use the Broadway stop. The room was clean, comfortable, and private. We didnt cook in the kitchen, but it was fully stocked and would have been easy to do so. The only thing to be aware of is it is a threestory unit with relatively steep and narrow stairs, so you have to be comfortable with that. Overall it was a great stay and I would definitely stay with John again.

Victor was fantastic, definitely one of the most welcoming hosts Ive had at an AirBnB. He was kind enough to let me check in early and brought me a bottle of wine and explained everything about the apartment.brbrThe place was perfect for one or two people and was decorated with many cool photographs. I especially appreciated the lefthanded electric guitars and collection of vintage effects pedals. The loft bed is comfortable, though a little tricky to jump in and out of, especially in the middle of the night when its dark. Everything is well laid out and convenient. There is a tiny kitchen area that has a small refrigerator stocked with snacks and bottled water, a very thoughtful touch. The bathroom was clean and well stocked with towels.brbrThe apartment is in an older building that seems to house a lot of students from the nearby college. The public stairwell areas seem kind of run down and dingy, but the apartment itself is nice and clean. brbrThe Green Line T stop is literally a 2 minute walk away. It was very convenient, even though the Green Line can take a while to get in and out of the city. brbrI had a great stay and would stay here again.

We had a lovely stay in Vickis apartment It was clean and comfortable and very spacious. Its also a very bright apartment which I liked but with good blinds to block out the early morning light I was visiting Boston for a conference in the World Trade Centre  this was an easy 30 minute walk away but there was also a convenient bus route for when I was feeling lazy There is a beautiful beach nearby, we had good weather so it was lovely to be able walk down to it. I travelled with my parents, we liked having access to the kitchen to make meals etc and not having to buy things like salt and pepper etc was handy. One minor comment from my parents who are about 70 years of age was that they found the stairs in this apartment steep  however at 30 years of age, I did not find this a problem. We enjoyed the setup of Vickis TV  access to TED talks, netflix as well as standard channels. This was nice for relaxing in the evenings. On arrival I realised we had not brought towels but luckily Vicki had left out a set, including face cloth, for each of us. I thought this was a nice touch. There is also a second toilet, which is handy for a group.brOverall I was really pleased with this apartment and Vicki was a really pleasant host.

We were having a trip from CA to Boston and booked the two rooms in Michelles place. Id say that these rooms are just ones of the best. Both of them were clean and cozy.

The kitchen was also clean and looked contemporary. We didnt use the living room a lot but the space was also welcoming. Personally, I would come back if I have a chance, and I would recommend these two rooms for a group of 14, or 5ish ppl as well.brPS their dog is also cute and super friendly

Lovely and comfortable home in Allston. We chose to use the Harvard Ave. Tstop to get into downtown Boston as it was a shorter walk than to Harvard Square. The space itself was perfect for my brother, sisterinlaw, myself and a puppy for our weekend stay in Boston. Thanks again

My parents and I love our stay here. Their dog, Bartok, was such a sweetheart. The rooms were incredibly clean and elegantly decorated. The home is located within walking distance to Harvard University My mom insisted on visiting the campus saying she wants her grand kids to attend but she has a good 20 years till that happens.

This was a great place to stay Everything was very clean. Julie provided us with whatever we needed and her communication was on point. Her dog will most likely become your new best friend so dont get too attached I would definitely come back to her place if I was ever in the area again. Thank you again

The bedrooms are cheerful and comfortable and feel private at their end of the house.  Access to the downstairs restroom in addition to the upstairs bathroom is a plus  as is having a designated parking space.  The back porch is delightful for casual dining on sunny days. Their sweet dog is quiet and wellbehaved.  They provide a special brush if you get puppy hair on you. The husband is a musician, so if you are looking for an opportunity to go enjoy some music, they may have some insider tips for you.

Michelle and Stephen are very lovely landlords. They get things very well organized. The place my family live is on the 2nd floor, which is very quiet and comfortable. The house is close to Harvard and MIT, and there is a small commercial street nearby which serves quality Asian food. We drive so didnt use the public transport much, but I do see the train station just a couple of meters away. They have a cute dog, who is very friendly and curious. The dog gives us a feeling of home. Michelle and Stephen are great communicators. They answered my questions via Airbnb extremely quickly. I would highly recommend them and their place.

Everything is in order here great space, great location, helpful hosts. An excellent lodging experience.

The house and rooms are exactly as pictured.  There was AC and a ceiling fan in each room, which made staying there during a heatwave very comfortable.  Its only a 5minute walk to the bus and a 2025 minute walk to Harvard Square.  The Trader Joes was really convenient for grabbing groceries on the way home.  Michelle and Stephen were helpful when we asked for suggestions or directions.  The house was not as clean as I expected bedrooms needed dusting and vacuuming, tub needed a quick scrub, dog hair on sofas and stairs, etc., but it wasnt too bad.  One thing I wish we would have known is that there is a third bedroom on the same floor as the two AirBnB bedrooms and bathroom that the owners use for their own personal guests, so there may be other people staying there.  It was okay, I guess, but I feel like its something that we should have been told in advance.  Overall, the space worked well for our needs, as I was spending a week at Harvard for work and traveling with my toddler and a babysitter.  The space was pretty childfriendly and comfortable.

Michelles place is exactly as advertised and worked perfectly for me, my wife and teenage daughter. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. It was warm when we were in town so the efficient, quiet AC units were much appreciated.  You will also have access to your own private bathroom and anything you need on the first floor, including a second half bathroom. We felt we had all the privacy we needed, but Michelle or her husband were always available for some quick advice or a friendly chat.  They also have a wonderful, quiet dog, who will ignore you unless you want his company. brbrThere is convenient mass transit to downtown Boston via the MBTA line. We used it to get to Fenway, just one stop and we didnt have to pay, thanks for the tip Michelle. We also used Uber a few times. You wont be disappointed if you book your stay with Michelle.

What a lovely experience If youre by chance coming to Boston and looking for a really comfortable space, in a beautiful and charming Victorian house in the nicest and friendliest neighborhood, this is it Melissa is an exceptionally amazing host and has the special ability to transform your stay in unforgettable moments of happiness. The house is located in less than a 5min walk from the subway station Orange Line, but the neighborhood has got pretty much everything you need in a short distance. Would highly recommend to anyone Cant describe how grateful I was after those weeks.

Melissa is a very welcoming host. I was greeted at the front door by Melissa and her doggo scout, who was very excited to see me. From there you get to check out her apartment which has a nice kitchen that I got to use as a long term guest.

Tom was an excellent host who went out of his way to communicate and make the airbnb process run smoothly, especially for me, a newbie to this system. Tom and his site manager made our visit simple and pleasant.   The unit is located in a nice neighborhood with easy access to everything great about Boston.  We ditched our rental car as we got to town and took the subway or walked where we wanted to go.  The unit was clean and airy, and a refreshing change after a week in single hotel rooms with a family of 4. Be aware that this unit is on the 4th floor and the stairs are tiny and spiral, so hauling the luggage in and out was the only real challenge we had.

We stayed for the month of August. We wanted to learn if we would like living in a major city, or if we liked living a few miles away in Arlington.brbrThe host is excellent, very responsive to email. Theres also a local person who is available for emergencies. brbrSize wise, its small but not cramped, good for the two of us. The bathroom is a little cramped.brbrKitchen stuff is provided, there are pots and pans, plates and flatware, and a good sized fridge. We ate most meals in the apartment. The grocery store is a 5minute walk away, there are at least four beerwine stores within a 5minute walk, and lots of restaurants. We highly recommend J.P. Licks.brbrLaundry is inbuilding and theres a laundry hamper. Detergent was provided.  Doing laundry requires going up and down four flights of stairs, so be prepared. It was 2.50 each for wash and dry. It takes quarters, if you need some there are two laundromats in Beacon Hill that make change. brbrThe mattresses were ok. There are two chairs in the living room which are nice, and an uncomfortable futon. brbrThe location was the best part about the apartment. We continued to work while staying there, and our commutes improved. We had easy access to all parts of the city. I did a lot of reading on the esplanade, and rented books from the public library. We went to SoWa, an outdoor market in the South End, on Sundays. There were free concerts on the esplanade every Wednesday. There was usually something happening on Boston Common. We went to a couple of museums we hadnt been to before. Local churches had singing events where you could just go in and sing.brbrIf youre a tourist and will be staying for a month, this was a pretty inexpensive way to do it. brbrWere glad we tried living in Boston, and we learned what we like and what we dont. Were grateful to have had Tom hosting us.

What an amazing place So much better than coming home to a hotel room. Susan and David are exceptional hosts and their place is comfortable, clean, spacious and well appointed. Susan is great about communicating with you prior to your arrival and during your stay to make sure everything is going well for you. Perfect for a a family with two small children. Sleeping accommodations are a little tight for 4 adults. The highlight had to be the rooftop deck. We had breakfast up there and were lucky enough to see the sunset while enjoying our favorite beverages. Boston is a beautiful city to see and because its fairly condensed, its easy to get around using the T and by walking. We walked MILES each day and were so happy to come back to this beautiful spot and relax after a long day. Susan and David,  THANK YOU, for helping us have a truly remarkable experience in Boston. If youre ever in Seattle  please give us a call.

SueDavids place is not only beautiful the woodwork on the stairs alone is incredible and comfortable it is perfectly located for exploring.  Dont forget good walking shoesbrbrWe stayed for a conference at the Boston Convention Center.  We opted to skip on a rental car you really dont need one and took taxis to the convention while using our legs and the subway for everything else.  We enjoyed meals at SRV, China Town go with an empty belly, the food there is amazing and Little Italy to name a few stops.  We walked to a game at Fenway go plenty early and be prepared to say wow..There is much to do and see outside of the stadium.  I have never cared for baseball, so I have never watched a game.  I am now a convert.  We got to know everyone sitting around us even though we were not chearing for the home team.  I had loads of questions and it got to a point where the people sitting around us started piping in with explanations and began pointing things out to me.  Really was a highlight for our trip.brbrNext time, we would like to go to the symphony which is just down the road.  brbrAs to the house itself.  When they say stairs, they do indeed mean stairs.  After a long day of walking those stairs look considerably higher than they truly are.  But, each room has its own temp control and soothing AC.  Once you breach the threshold the climb is quickly forgotten.  brbrThe kitchen has everything you could wantneed.  If you like listening to music, there are a couple of speakers you can sync your phone to.  The little JBL packs quite the punch for being so little.  There is a table in the family room which was a perfect work station for myself and there are views from every room.  There were plenty of linnenstowels and a washer and dryer if you should happen to need to freshen up.brbrLast piece.  Bring your camera up to the roof.  The views at any time are pretty and they become spectacular in the morning and evenings.brbrYou wont be disappointed staying at this house, but you will find yourself wondering where the time went

We LOVED staying at Matt and Evas place. I had never been to Boston and there were many cute places to choose from in Jamaica Plain. I love old quirky houses with character and this one is extra special with the turret and the outstanding views of Boston. This apartment was a combination of all the things I love unique, simple, stylish, comfortable, great location, helpful accommodating hosts. The place just has a very good vibe overall. One thing Im very picky about is my bed, and you can never tell how that will be with an air bnb because often guests dont comment on that. Both beds were amazingly luxuriously comfortable. We slept soooo good. The mattresses are high quality and the sheets so, so soft Pillows perfect too. Each room in the house has its own temperature controls. I worry about old houses being draftynot so with this one. We were plenty warm. Lots of houses in Jamaica Plain are crowded and close together but this one has space around it so it feels more private than a lot of other houses in the area. It was a quiet neighborhood. The apartment has everything you need. We will definitely be staying again and I feel so lucky that I chose right because there were so many choices and its rare to get it right on the first try  Thank you Matt and Eva

The neighborhood and apartment both felt very safe. Minor background noise from other residence, but nothing major. Not super big, but holds two very comfortably. I would highly recommend this place

This apartment was extremely clean and functional. The laundry room was just around the corner hall make sure you have quarters, and it was easy to slip in and out to do the laundry. The T Station is just across the street, very convenient access to downtown in 1520 minutes. I was there for 5 weeks, and never felt unsafe. The people in the building were very nice. Walkable to a lovely little beach, a nice diner, some fast food places, and a dry cleaners. I had a great stay. This apartment was quiet, even though planes could be heard outside. The air conditioning was great. No cable TV, but my computer hooked up for Netflix, Amazon, etc. with the wi fi, and I actually watched quite a bit of antenna TV, as PBS and several networks came in clearly. It was a good stay.

This apartment is ideal for long term stay. It is conveniently located directly across from Orient Heights T station, and is surrounded by great restaurants, including a fantastic craft beer pub just around the corner. The local shop is a stones throw away and has everything one could need. The apartment was warm during my stay in NovDec, and I felt right at home. Thanks for a great stay, Gavin

Even though we were only staying here for a night during a layover, I would definitely consider this spot for a longer stay. It was a very nice renovation in an older building with plenty of space and a modern, wellequipped kitchen. We personally really liked the neighborhood yes, it is directly across the water from Logan airport. But youd be surprised how relatively quiet it is, and the noise from the planes was really not an issue.

Terrys place was great  it was easy to find, we took Uber from the airport, approx 1520 min drive, and around 75, but we were 6 adults plus luggage.  The neighborhood was quiet and nice, we had no issues.  Terrys place had everything you would need, 3 good size bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, living room and kitchen, as described.  We were 3 couples travelling together.  Terry was easily reached when we needed him or to ask a question, but never actually came to the unit.brI wouldnt hesitate to stay there again, it made for a great trip to Boston

I feel so conflicted about this Airbnb. The space is lovely. The carpeted, narrow stairs lead to a warm, comfortable living space on the top two floors. The kitchen is especially nice it feels larger than it looks and was equipped with everything we needed. The bedrooms are roomy, especially the king bedroom which has several chairs, a loveseat in the corner, and an old stereo that still works somewhat well the radio, but not the CD player. The bathrooms are clean and had just enough toilet paper for us, something I consider an Airbnb must The neighborhood wasnt a place to hang but didnt feel particularly unsafe, and we loved the short walk to the train.brbrTerry is very kind and was good at responding to our problems but wasnt as effective when it came to solving them. When we first arrived, he was helpful in getting us inside, and he took care of a mysterious orange liquid in the basement where the laundry is located. Unfortunately, our bigger issues were ongoing, the first of which was 85 construction happening in the adjacent unit. Terry hadnt let us know about this, and it may bother most guests, but for us nighttime workers, this wasnt a great fit. There were ladders, saws, and coffee cups left on our front step. There was also an animal in the walls of the kingsize bedroom that woke me up at 630a every day. When he got into the ceiling, my friend in the next bedroom would hear it too. I asked Terry about it the first week but no one ever came to check it out. Lastly, Terry asked us on Dec 22 if we could move out on Thursday Christmas Eve because a booking had come in a while ago I had booked in August and we could move back the next day Christmas. He offered a space across the street. I insisted that this was too much for us, so he consented to let us stay, but it was exasperating and disappointing to feel unwanted.brbrOverall, this place is nice enough for you to roll the dice I hope it was just a weird combination of circumstances that diminished our experience.

One of the nicest places Ive stayed in Boston. Situated on a quiet, charming old world street with warm, tasteful, comfortable rooms. Very comfortable firm mattresses, functional kitchen, privacy, and plenty of space. This place has personality and is not a hotel. You can hear people coming and going from the other units, one of the showers is in an old claw foot tub with less than robust water pressure, but the linens are crisp clean and abundant, the furniture is very comfortable, and its a space I sincerely enjoyed being in.

My guests were extremely happy and cozy.  It was hot in Boston and the window ac units were very good.

The apartment was wonderful. The towels and shampooconditioner in the bathroom made it feel like a hotel. The beds were very comfortable, and a variety of dishes and utensils made it easy to cook. Our only issues were the flights of stairs to get to the apartment. You had to climb three flights and the last one was extremely narrow, steep and curved. It made it very difficult to haul all of our stuff upstairs. Also parking on the street was an issue on Tuesdays, since they do street cleaning. It took us an hour to find a spot. Otherwise it was a great experience.

Three friends and I came to Boston for our 4th annual baseball trip from June 37. We had great time and were very pleased with the apartment. We are a group of 4 big guys, and the apartment did not feel small at all. The bed and pullout hold 4 easily, but there is also room for 1 or 2 air matresses as well so sleeping room wasnt a problem.brbrThe location was very convenient to hop on the Orange subway line which took us everywhere we wanted. We got the week Link Pass which was great so we could jump on and of the subway as many times as we wanted.brbrThe kitchen in the apartment was very nice, all the appliances you might need. Bathroom and shower were good as well. Our only complaint would be the internet, it was slow and consistently dropped when the 4 of us were on WiFi at the same time. When it was only one or two people, it worked better, but was still a little slow. We mentioned it to Terry on our first day and he came over and talked to us right away which was very nice of him. We actually noticed an improvement when we moved it out of the cast iron lamp table which we thought may have been creating a dead zone because of the metal surrounding it. brbrOverall, we had a great time and would definitely stay here again on another trip to Boston.

Kathy was very responsive to messages, gave clear instructions, and had reasonable house rules. Her place was clean, close to food and shopping, and also a short walk to transit. She had extra blankets, pillows, and sleeping options. Having a pack n play available was really helpful. Also, having coffee and snacks available got us through our first night from a long and tiring drive. I was surprised how many toiletries she had for us to use. Luckily, we were able to rent a parking space which was so convenient. Full disclosure, the only criticisms would be the steps out of her gate were hard to get a stroller over and the shower pipe comes out at a weird angle so we had to hold the handle to shower. Neither of which was a big deal to us and would not deter me from using this space again. This was my first Air Bnb stay and it was an enjoyable one Id definitely recommend this unit.

This is a nice, clean property in a fun walkable area.  It is on a little side street connected to a park area with community gardens, dog park and play ground.  It is very close to the Orange line of the T.  It is close to markets and restaurants.  The amenities were nice since we had a busy itinerary.  There was coffee, milk and waters, snacks, toiletries, a hair dryer and iron.  We had 6 adults.  There are two large bedrooms with King size beds and a couch that pulls out and a twin blow up mattress.  Check in and check out were very easy and communicating with Kathy was quick and easy.  We added the parking spot at the last minute and this was handled easily. I wish we had found this place during the last four years my son was at Northeastern.  So much more pleasant than our hotel stays  I would highly recommend this listing.

Not just being clean and nice place, the host also provided plenty of things like books, laundry, bath supplies, snack bars, bottled water etc. So when the family just arrived tiredly, all the cleanness and supplies made our arrival easy and comfy, feeling like another home The host Kathy also is very responsive and helpful so the whole stay went very smooth. I really feel lucky that we picked Kathys place and greatly appreciate it. I will definitely recommend this place to my family and friends who want to visit Boston.

The location is tops, and the place is very large.  Gloria and her son who showed us in were very responsive and polite.  Its fun old place with a unique character.  Despite its age, there is central air conditioning, which was much needed and appreciated in early August.  It is sparsely furnished without a lot of creature comforts and fancy decor, but they were not promised or pictured anyway.  If I ever need a place that large again in Boston, I will certainly go back.

Jays place in Bostons Beacon Hill was our first AirBB, so I was very pleased to find the compact 2 bedroom apartment accurately described. We were comfortably ensconced here for a 3 night stay. I had been concerned about the key handover which had at first glance seemed complex, but all went well and we had no problems with it at all. We didnt meet Jay but it was nice knowing he was only a text or phone call away and managed to help us sort out our only real problem when our teenaged son locked us all out of the bathroom The necessary tool was available in the apartment although Jay did say that was the first time anyone had ever managed this feat My son who has used Air B B before said that the provision of bathroom essentials was particularly good. Id certainly recommend the Historic Beacon Hill location which we found both convenient to walk into the harbour area and very quiet and attractive.

We 2 adults  1 toddler had three nights at Jays apartment and we have nothing but praise for such a great apartment and host. I would go as far to say its the BEST Airbnb accommodation Ive stayed at to date. brJay was a very attentive host. He sent through all the location details, access information for the building, and replied to all our queries promptly.brbrDespite the previous guests still being at the apartment when we arrived, Jay kept me updated, Jess the cleaner came in right away once theyd left and got the place looking spick and span.  The apartment had all the amenities and then some you could possibly need. Its in the best location near supermarkets, restaurants, bars and liquor stores. Its only a stones throw from the train line, and walking distance to all the tourist sights. Beacon Hill itself is a very pretty place with lots of boutique shops, cafes and good coffee. My only gripe and its hardly worth a mention would be to say the bed in the far bedroom sagged a little in the middle, but the linen was luxurious and clean and pillows were comfy. brbrThanks for making our trip to Boston a good one Jay.brbrFYI  Do yourself a favour and stay at Jays if you are ever in Boston. Its a lovely apartment in a great city.  My only advice would be dont bother with a car. You wont need it and parking is very expensive as we learned the hard way.  br

400 Columbus was in an excellent location, within walking distance of public transportation, many restaurants, and grocery stores.  The studio apartment was very small, which wasnt too much of an issue.  It could get noisy at night, but that is to be expected with staying in downtown Boston.  However, there was some torn carpet with sharp pieces exposed underneath, which was a concern.  Also, the drain in the shower was very slow, causing an accumulation of several inches of water during showers.  Check in and check out were simple, hasslefree, and communicated clearly.  I would stay here again if the aforementioned issues were repaired.

This studio is perfect for a couples or solo weekend trip to the Boston area. The space was small but well utilized. While there are parking garages suggested, you could also find free parking about a 10 minute walk away on Massachusetts Ave. Within a 5 minute walk of the studio, there is a wineliquor store, late night dining, and access to the T. This place is super convenient if you might be checking in late in the evening, because Alicia sends access codes to the main door and front door prior to arrival. The only downsides to this apartment are that the shower drain is a little slow, and the carpet is coming up at the entrance to the kitchenette. Those are really nonissues though, considering how great the location, convenience, and studio itself is.

I loved staying here The location was convenient for quick access to Northeastern University, Copley Square, and public transit. The walls were a bit thin, but there were no major noise problems. The climb up the stairs with my luggage wasnt as bad as I thought it would be The laundry was convenient and easy to use although it took 2 cycles in the dryer for my clothes to be fully dry. The space was clean and perfect for 12 guests. Maverick and his associates did a great job answering my questions promptly Would definitely recommend.

Great location, in walking distance of Back Bay station, secure lock made it easy to navigate doors. Small but comfortable.  Microwave , fridge and kitchen area are an added value. Shower area needs some updates.   Carpets were a challenge because I am allergic. Some noise from outside because it is a major road.

Fine apartment, but I wouldnt stay there again. Carpet was gross with stains and it didnt even look like it had been vacuumed before we arrived. Long dark hairs left on the clean towels as well. Many spots were quite dusty. Couch worn out. Doors to the outside in the larger bedroom in the basement were left unlocked and we didnt realize until a couple of days after we had been staying there. Alicias response was that the lock is tricky. Also the UPS store next door creates a lot of overhead noise as half of the apartment is in a basement. Toilet runs for about 20 minutes after flushing. Not great value because they supply almost nothing not even more than a roll of toilet paper per stay. Look elsewhere.

Alicias place was great. We were there to attend a conference at Hynes and it was just a five minute walk. The place was neat and spacious , but the carpet in the basement didnt smell great. Except for the smelly carpet everything else about Alicias place is great, its situated in the middle of the city and most places are just 15 minutes away if we take the T.

This apartment was fun to stay at.  We ended up liking the South End. Parking was a pain because there were no meters in the area because it was all South End residential parking only.  We needed to find a place fast same day because our other rental did not have hot water.  It took a while to hear back about 2 hours from the host in that situation.  The wifi did not work although it showed we were connected. The spiral staircase was fun but very narrow and hard to navigate with luggage.  Also, wish the bathroom was not downstairs.

This place is generally pretty good. Beds are comfortable, water in the shower gets warm immediately, kitchen works perfectly fine, and couch can be made into a passable bed if more than 2 people are staying. Communication is fast and works out well.brLocation is very close to Newbury Street, and walking downtown is extremely easy, as it is literally just one street you have to walk for like 20 to 30 minutes.

The sofa was very uncomfortable to sleep once opened as a bed. The apartment has less natural light than the photos show. The place is quite good to stay a few days and sleep, but a bit small to stay several hours during the day if you are 5 guests.

I went to Boston for a weekend with a few friends, just to explore the city. Mavericks place was the perfect place to stay. Firstly, the location is awesome  so walkable for everything downtown. Secondly, the place has everything youd need. We really just slept there, but the beds and bathroom were clean, there was a good amount of space for 4 people. Mavericks responses were fast and helpful.
facilities positive
This apartment is in a great location, however, the unit had the bare minimum. The internet was very slow, several sockets did not work, water pressure in the shower was low, the bedding resembled cheap hotel sheets, and the mattresses were uncomfortable. Additionally, even though the overpowering scent of fabuloso gave off the impression that the apartment was clean, I noticed crumbs and change when pulling out the pull out bed in the couch. Unfortunately, my overall impression of this place was cheap and insufficiently cleaned. If these things do not bother you and you plan to be out on the town all day then this place may suit your needs.

The location is fantastic  South End is beautiful. Its conveniently located near bikes, the T, Back Back, and Fenway Park. Yet, if youre looking for a comfortable bed you might be disappointed as the bed in the guest bedroom wasnt even level. Definitely only worth a short stay.

Mavericks place is very well located for me, I was in a Conference in Hynes Convention Center, inside Prudential Center. Less than 10 min walking. The apartment is clean, spacious and well decorated. There is a small stair to go down to the bedrooms and bathroom. Checkin and out very easy, safe place. I needed a late checkour and wasnt possible to realize, of course this is not part of the contract, but 2 hours more would help me a lot. Everything ok

Good location, shame about the beds. This apartment is in a nice area, not far to walk into the city or for restaurants.brUnfortunately the beds are awful and ruined our stay there. The main bedroom has a bed base that creaks loudly with every movement, and the second room has a hard futon mattress that is very uncomfortable.brThere is only seating in the lounge for 3 guests, and despite other reviewers saying there was insufficient cutlery, this had not been resolved.brIf the owner spend a bit of money this could be very nice.
facilities negative
The place was in a good location.  I was attending a conference at Hynes Convention center so I was able to walk there in 10 minutes.  However it was quite dirty, with a lot of work needed to bring it to even a respectable level of cleanliness.  The shower door fell off the track and I was not able to close it entirely.  It was also very noisy as I could hear anyone coming through a gate and a walkway between the buildings.  It needs a really deep cleaning to be a comfortable place to stay as well as some TLC all around.

I traveled to Boston for an education conference at Copley Marriott. The Air BB location was great, very close to downtown and what I needed was accessible by walking. However, the quality of the Air BB was disappointing. brbrThe glass stove was cracked, so I didnt attempt to use. The toilet was risky sometimes it worked, other times it didnt. They did offer to send someone out, but I left the following morning.brThe beds are not comfortable at all. Honestly, sleeping on the floor would have been more comfortable, but the carpet is dirty, so I dont recommend that. I did message the owner after I left but no response.

This was the best airbnb stay we’ve had so far. The apartment is cozy in a great location. We were able to walk everywhere on foot.

The location is tops, and the place is very large.  Gloria and her son (who showed us in) were very responsive and polite.  It's fun old place with a unique character.  Despite its age, there is central air conditioning, which was much needed and appreciated in early August.  It is sparsely furnished without a lot of creature comforts and fancy decor, but they were not promised or pictured anyway.  If I ever need a place that large again in Boston, I will certainly go back.

This is a fantastic location, very close to everything. The stairs are definitely steep and people who stay here should be fit enough to handle 3 flights of steep narrow stairs. We thought it helped us work off some delicious Boston food! A charming brownstone home.

Gloria's house is perfect for visiting Boston and truly living its history and heritage. Yes, there are a lot of steps to get up and down but that's part of the experience. The house provided plenty of space for my group of 5 adults and 2 young kids. Only feedback I would provide Gloria is around cleanliness and overall upkeep. The high chair provided was flight and had not been cleaned. The shower drains need a good snake to ensure the water flows. However, other than these minor items, the house was spectacular and met our needs perfectly. Thanks Gloria!

This place is in a great location and yes the rooftop deck is nice -- as long as the many others in the building aren't overrunning it as they did the one nice day we could use it. BUT this is a very shabby place -- old, not in the least bit updated and no effort at all has been put into making it a bit nicer. The two bathrooms are outdated and odd (one toilet leaked and in the other the shower has a window open to the hallway!) The "owner's bedroom" where I slept has no lamp, no closet, flimsy barely-covering window coverings and an old, thin blanket on the twin bed with no headboard to keep the pillows from falling off. It is heated by a radiator that had no way to control it so I was stifling hot one night and freezing the next. This is in no way a five-star place -- I'd say 3. It is basically clean and if you're looking for a great location, it is that. But that's all it has going for it.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay on Beacon Hill! The place was exactly as pictured and described and VERY clean and tidy. Jay was extremely responsive and friendly. He was also very flexible, allowing us to drop off our luggage before the designated check-in time so that we could begin enjoying Boston. We also met his cleaning person, Jess, who made the place look great and was very friendly. She gave us some very helpful information for using the T, which is a short walk from Jay's place. The building was secure, and the location fantastic. We walked nearly everywhere. I would definitely stay again!

The location of the apartment is amazing. The place is very new. The beds and pillows are comfortable, the bathroom was clean, the kitchen has everything you need.

Jay's place in Boston's Beacon Hill was our first AirB&B, so I was very pleased to find the compact 2 bedroom apartment accurately described. We were comfortably ensconced here for a 3 night stay. I had been concerned about the key handover which had at first glance seemed complex, but all went well and we had no problems with it at all. We didn't meet Jay but it was nice knowing he was only a text or phone call away and managed to help us sort out our only real problem when our teenaged son locked us all out of the bathroom! The necessary tool was available in the apartment although Jay did say that was the first time anyone had ever managed this feat! My son who has used Air B& B before said that the provision of bathroom essentials was particularly good. I'd certainly recommend the Historic Beacon Hill location which we found both convenient to walk into the harbour area and very quiet and attractive.

This apartment is clean, modern and in a great location in Beacon Hill. After long days of walking around Boston we loved chilling out in the living area and using the wifi and watching cable TV. <br/><br/>Jay communicated clear instructions for gaining entry to the apartments and we loved the guidebooks for Boston that were in the apartment. <br/><br/>Great 2 bedroom - would definitely recommend this apartment!

<br/>Despite the previous guests still being at the apartment when we arrived, Jay kept me updated, Jess the cleaner came in right away once they'd left and got the place looking spick and span.  The apartment had all the amenities and then some you could possibly need. It's in the best location near supermarkets, restaurants, bars and liquor stores. It's only a stones throw from the train line, and walking distance to all the tourist sights. Beacon Hill itself is a very pretty place with lots of boutique shops, cafes and good coffee. My only gripe (and it's hardly worth a mention) would be to say the bed in the far bedroom sagged a little in the middle, but the linen was luxurious and clean and pillows were comfy.

They just want to profit from the property but no investment to it, i can’t believe how someone like this host can be a super host. I would NOT RECOMMEND.

400 Columbus was in an excellent location, within walking distance of public transportation, many restaurants, and grocery stores.  The studio apartment was very small, which wasn’t too much of an issue.  It could get noisy at night, but that is to be expected with staying in downtown Boston.  However, there was some torn carpet with sharp pieces exposed underneath, which was a concern.  Also, the drain in the shower was very slow, causing an accumulation of several inches of water during showers.  Check in and check out were simple, hassle-free, and communicated clearly.  I would stay here again if the aforementioned issues were repaired.

This studio is perfect for a couple's or solo weekend trip to the Boston area. The space was small but well utilized. While there are parking garages suggested, you could also find free parking about a 10 minute walk away on Massachusetts Ave. Within a 5 minute walk of the studio, there is a wine/liquor store, late night dining, and access to the T. This place is super convenient if you might be checking in late in the evening, because Alicia sends access codes to the main door and front door prior to arrival. The only downsides to this apartment are that the shower drain is a little slow, and the carpet is coming up at the entrance to the kitchenette. Those are really non-issues though, considering how great the location, convenience, and studio itself is.

The apartment was clean and bright! It’s location is perfect for walking to the Prudential Center, and is convenient for getting to other neighborhoods too because it’s so centrally located. The space was definitely on the smaller side, but its very functional and is basically like staying in a 4 star hotel, but with a much more affordable price. Would stay here again!

We came to Boston for the first time and honestly this location is great! We were able to walking everywhere , especially downtown! Everything was very clean and communication between the Maverick owners and customers was clear and timely. I would only change the size of the bed to a queen seeing that full size beds are a little small for two guests. Also, we had no hand soap in the bathroom which we had to buy for our weekend stay

This spot was the perfect location for me while I was in a wedding nearby. It's also conveniently located to amenities. There's a really great diner just down the street! My only complaint. Is that the bed was a bit small. My boyfriend's feet hung off the bed and he's only 5'8". Of course me being 5'2", was very cozy in the bed. This place would also definitely be difficult for those with physical disabilities since it's an old walk up and everything is very narrow.

Fine apartment, but I wouldn't stay there again. Carpet was gross with stains and it didn't even look like it had been vacuumed before we arrived. Long dark hairs left on the "clean" towels as well. Many spots were quite dusty. Couch worn out. Doors to the outside in the larger bedroom in the basement were left unlocked and we didn't realize until a couple of days after we had been staying there. Alicia's response was that the lock is "tricky." Also the UPS store next door creates a lot of overhead noise (as half of the apartment is in a basement). Toilet runs for about 20 minutes after flushing. Not great value because they supply almost nothing- not even more than a roll of toilet paper per stay. Look elsewhere.

This apartment was fun to stay at.  We ended up liking the South End. Parking was a pain because there were no meters in the area because it was all South End residential parking only.  We needed to find a place fast (same day) because our other rental did not have hot water.  It took a while to hear back (about 2 hours) from the host in that situation.  The wifi did not work although it showed we were connected. The spiral staircase was fun but very narrow and hard to navigate with luggage.  Also, wish the bathroom was not downstairs.

I went to Boston for a weekend with a few friends, just to explore the city. Maverick's place was the perfect place to stay. Firstly, the location is awesome - so walkable for everything downtown. Secondly, the place has everything you'd need. We really just slept there, but the beds and bathroom were clean, there was a good amount of space for 4 people. Maverick's responses were fast and helpful.

This apartment is in a great location, however, the unit had the bare minimum. The internet was very slow, several sockets did not work, water pressure in the shower was low, the bedding resembled cheap hotel sheets, and the mattresses were uncomfortable. Additionally, even though the overpowering scent of fabuloso gave off the impression that the apartment was clean, I noticed crumbs and change when pulling out the pull out bed in the couch. Unfortunately, my overall impression of this place was cheap and insufficiently cleaned. If these things do not bother you and you plan to be out on the town all day then this place may suit your needs.

The location is fantastic - South End is beautiful. It’s conveniently located near bikes, the T, Back Back, and Fenway Park. Yet, if you’re looking for a comfortable bed you might be disappointed as the bed in the guest bedroom wasn’t even level. Definitely only worth a short stay.

Maverick’s place is very well located for me, I was in a Conference in Hynes Convention Center, inside Prudential Center. Less than 10 min walking. The apartment is clean, spacious and well decorated. There is a small stair to go down to the bedrooms and bathroom. Check-in and out very easy, safe place. I needed a late check-our and wasn’t possible to realize, of course this is not part of the “contract”, but 2 hours more would help me a lot. Everything ok

Good location, shame about the beds. This apartment is in a nice area, not far to walk into the city or for restaurants.<br/>Unfortunately the beds are awful and ruined our stay there. The main bedroom has a bed base that creaks loudly with every movement, and the second room has a hard futon mattress that is very uncomfortable.<br/>There is only seating in the lounge for 3 guests, and despite other reviewers saying there was insufficient cutlery, this had not been resolved.<br/>If the owner spend a bit of money this could be very nice.

The place was in a good location.  I was attending a conference at Hynes Convention center so I was able to walk there in 10 minutes.  However it was quite dirty, with a lot of work needed to bring it to even a respectable level of cleanliness.  The shower door fell off the track and I was not able to close it entirely.  It was also very noisy as I could hear anyone coming through a gate and a walkway between the buildings.  It needs a really deep cleaning to be a comfortable place to stay as well as some TLC all around.

I traveled to Boston for an education conference at Copley Marriott. The Air B&B location was great, very close to downtown and what I needed was accessible by walking. However, the quality of the Air B&B was disappointing. <br/><br/>The glass stove was cracked, so I didn't attempt to use. The toilet was risky; sometimes it worked, other times it didn't. They did offer to send someone out, but I left the following morning.<br/>The beds are not comfortable at all. Honestly, sleeping on the floor would have been more comfortable, but the carpet is dirty, so I don't recommend that. I did message the owner after I left but no response.

The location was perfect, a safe residential area very close to the T.

The property was as expected and the price was fair. My one complaint was that our stay was during the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. we contacted the host prior to our reservation date about canceling. The AirBNB website very clearly said that, due to the pandemic, reservations booked when ours was that were occurring when ours was could be cancelled with a full refund. <br/><br/>The host told me they don’t have to abide by that though and they make their own cancellation policy so, if we decided not to come, we would not get a refund. <br/><br/>That put us in a position I don’t think we should have had to be in. For hosts to have policies different than the global AirBNB policy, especially on something like this, makes me uncomfortable with using AirBNB again.

All the noise combined make it almost impossible to sleep. Other than the noise issues it is a great apartment.

I appreciated the communication throughout our stay and the actual studio space. The location was also great because it was a short walk away from restaurants, a shopping center and the public transit stop to explore the rest of Boston. You can easily walk to Boston Common and the public garden. The keypads were also very convenient and it was very easy and straightforward to check in.<br/><br/>However, the thin walls and loud disturbances by other guests made for a negative experience. I could clearly hear every word our neighboring resident was saying when she was on the phone at 1AM. Additionally, residents upstairs were constantly moving furniture around and speaking loudly from midnight to 2AM. You can also hear people stomping down the stairs. I didn't feel like I paid for a private space since it's so easy to hear other residents. It felt like a communal space.<br/><br/>If you don't mind the outside noise and are a heavy sleeper, then it's not a bad place to stay.
mood negative
Its very close to downtown. 5 minutes walking will take you to shopping mall, and back bay station (Orange line). It's can be noisy a little depending on your neighbors I could hear everything (talking from nextdoor walking on stairs etc.) Still it was a very nice worthy place to stay. since what I needed form this place is nice sleep and shower. I highly recommend this place if you are traveling alone. if you worry about noise just bring a pair of nice ear plugs.  it would be hard to find this nice place with this price.

I stayed here for 5 nights and my check in experience was easy, the host was communicative, & the location was good. My criticism is that I felt pretty unsafe in the apartment because there was no deadbolt to do it from the inside and just a passcode outside. The host said there should’ve been a “privacy please” door hanger in the unit door but there wasn’t one, so I found it unnerving that cleaners came and went when I didn’t want anyone in the place (and actively didn’t select any cleaning services during my stay) due to Covid. Additionally, the walls are THIN. When I say thin, I mean like I could hear the faucet and dishes clinking as my neighbors did their dishes, every word of their conversations, and even what show they were watching on TV and they were definitely speaking at a normal volume. The hallways were dirty and smelled pretty bad as well. For me I would’ve rather paid more for some more privacy and quiet. Wouldn’t stay here again.

The home was exactly as pictured, but BARE BONES. No one lives in this apartment, it is strictly used for AirBNB (along with the rest of the building by the looks of it).  There's a smattering of dishware and few pieces of silverware, but don't expect to use the kitchen. The location is perfect for getting around the city, and for a short stay the lack of a blow dryer, extra linens/towels, paper towels, etc...  wasn't a deal breaker, just a little disappointing.  Based on the price I would probably pick a hotel next time, but it worked for this stay.

We felt like we were camping. This apartment does not belong to an individual, but rather is managed by a serviced apartment company. Clearly, no one had attempted to live in the space, as it was simply not functional. Only the smaller of the two electric burners functioned, and only anemically. The fridge door was missing its shelves. There were no cleaning products of any kind in the apartment (not even a sponge!), which meant we had to buy our own for a week-long stay. Spending a week without a vacuum or a mop is a challenge. Basic kitchen provisions were missing as well. A bizarre "emergency exit" door separates the kitchenette from another apartment, through which every word and every breath may be heard. This situation was so uncomfortable, we considered leaving the first night. The bathroom is so small that one must sit side-saddle on the toilet, like a 19th-century woman on horseback. The air conditioning does not adequately cool even the tiny studio, making sleep difficult.

Upon arrival our unit had not been cleaned and it was apparent the previous occupants had been using drugs which were left in the apartment. The television was still on, bed unmade and clothes left.

We ended up staying in the original unit after it had been deep cleaned and sanitised and the locks changed. We ended up having a pleasant stay and our queries were handled quickly and professionally. It seemed our case was an anomaly and we were very happy with how it was handled. The location is perfect for a few days stay in Boston and I can’t recommend Mohammed enough for his assistance.

Right to the point:<br/>- Expect your bed to be much different from the pictures on the listing. We had a mattress on metal springs as a box, not an actual headboard with nice pillows.<br/><br/>- Cooking in the room? I'd first start looking at if the stove top works because ours was a nightmare. <br/><br/>It has two tops: a smaller one and the one that works. The working one has a defective knob beyond belief. Moving the knob to "high" meant "low" and moving the pan a little  meant "time to shut down". <br/><br/>- That tan dresser you see in the pictures? Yeah no, we didn't have that. Instead, we had a nice view of the breaker box and had to pull our clothes out of our suitcase.<br/><br/>I know, I know... every room will be different but when you had to pay extra because of an emergency and you receive a room without its amenities, it really does get to you.

There are many great things about this unit - the location is fantastic, the building is beautiful, the unit was clean and generally as described, and the staff responds quickly when contacted.  <br/><br/>However, I unfortunately still cannot recommend this unit to almost anyone for one major reason: there is essentially no sound separation between it and the neighboring unit.  All that separates them is a standard (emergency-exit-marked) door with no "seal" at the bottom, so you can hear anything from the other apartment as clearly as if it were coming from the next room in your house (and vice versa). Alarm clocks, the TV, normal-volume conversations - all were very audible. If your neighbors choose to fall asleep with the TV on, you're gonna be sleeping with the TV on too.  If they set a 5 AM alarm, you're waking up at 5 AM as well.  This would perhaps be reasonable for a hostel setting, but if you are advertising your place as an "entire apartment," it really shouldn't include this type of drawback that absolutely no one would put up with in their own apartment.<br/><br/>I must therefore reluctantly advise against booking this unit until when and if this issue is resolved, except under very specific circumstances (e.g. you also book Apartment 4, or you are deaf). If the host does resolve it, then I would change my advice entirely and heartily recommend it. I requested a refund over this issue (which was denied) and was told that this would be "addressed with ownership," so hopefully it will not be a problem forever.<br/><br/>(Also be sure to check the refrigerator's temperature setting - it does not give you any information on the actual temperature, but the coldest settings are cold enough to turn it into a freezer.  I was unfortunate enough to have everything I put in it ruined because the previous guests had left it on "7.")

Excellent location in Boston's picturesque, charming South End, centrally located to everything one could need! This studio/suite is not very large but is bright and airy, and was moderately clean when I arrived. There was a fair amount of outside noise in the unit—from vehicles on the street, guests in the adjacent unit, the laundry machine and people in the hallway—though it was not particularly disruptive to my stay. Overall this unit met my needs for a short trip.

Great location and cute apartment. It was extremely basic In terms of accessories. I would recommend bringing or buying your own body wash. The bathroom is also extremely tiny, so if you’re a larger person keep that in mind. The bathroom door and shower door wont open at the same time. The room is also a tad outdated. It came with cable but no smart tv. And the tv was tiny.  For bedding there were lots of pillows but the thinnest sheet and blanket. Bed was also comfortable. The room does have an ac and heater, so this actually didn’t effect us. For the price I would have thought it would be a little more updated, but it definitely got the job done.

This apartment was very nice.  It's close to our daughters home and in a great neighborhood. The patio outside was a nice area to have my morning coffee overlooking the bay. This will be our place to stay when we visit our daughter in the future. Amy was very nice and communicated with us throughout our stay. She was very inviting. This was our first airbb and I was really impressed. Could not have asked for a better vacation in Boston!!

Gina's place was fantastic. Close to transportation, the great food of the North End, the fabulous waterfront, in the shadows of the Old North Church and close just about anything else you'd want. The place was clean, charming, and with a hint of intrigue as it was found tucked behind a corridor that gives you a feeling that you're entering a secret hideaway. Gina was extremely responsive and got back to us immediately if we had a question. I would recommend staying here without question. My family and I really enjoyed our stay.

This was a first-rate experience:  a clean, well-appointed apartment, an attentive, pro-active host, and a great North End location.  The rooms, one could say, are slightly smaller than typical, but really they are very much adequate in size.  Also the spiral staircase can be a little tricky.  Still, I include these details to present a balanced view, but make no mistake, this is a great option for a first-rate Boston experience, only a few short blocks from Mike's Pastries and the literally hundreds of wonderful restaurants and coffee/dessert shops of the North End.  A few steps further (9 minute walk) gets you to Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market, and another 10 minutes perhaps to Park Street, the State House, and Boston Common.  You will be very close to the airport here, and much less subject to traffic challenges getting in and out of town.

Gina was gracious and helpful even before we arrived at the condo, helping us arrange to drop off luggage early and sending us information on the neighborhood and restaurants there and elsewhere in Boston. Fresh flowers and a welcome note awaited us when we arrived. She was concerned and prompt in addressing a small problem we had with an appliance (our fault-user error!) after we arrived. Just a few steps from the condo onto Salem or Hanover Streets were more restaurants, shops and sites than we could take in in the few days we were there.  The lovely greenway a few blocks south on the way to the T station (Boston subway) was a refreshingly open area in this urban enclave of narrow streets and dense housing. Being an historically Italian neighborhood, most things were deliciously food oriented - just what we love! The two-level condo itself was very charming, furnishings were stylish and very comfortable and the kitchen was just great! Having a half bath in addition to  the full bath made the place very comfortable for the 3 of us staying there.  Having the 2 bedrooms at opposite ends of the hallway, downstairs from the public areas meant everyone had their privacy and could sleep or be active on their own schedule. Everything was perfectly clean. This was a great comfortable place to stay, with good, easy access to all parts of Boston.

What a fabulous little apartment. Firstly if you're arriving by plane it's just a $20 cab ride from the airport. The location is great, in lovely North End close to the city centre, surrounded by mostly Italian restaurants, cafes and delis. It's a short walk to the waterfront, downtown and shopping areas. The apartment is compact but beautifully furnished equipped and decorated.  Gina has thought of pretty much everything with a great coffee machine, helpful info about the neighbourhood and everything you might need during your stay in the city.

La Gemma was the perfect location to explore the North End and easy access to the rest of Boston and Cambridge via Uber.  Gina was a gracious hostess and very easy to communicate with.

This is THE place to stay in the North End.  Charming and cozy, the apartment is steps from the Old North Church and the Freedom Trail and pretty close to the T.

Gina's place was in the center of Boston, within walking distance of most visitor attractions.  The condo is very tastefully decorated (loved the clock in the living room). The only slightly negative aspect was the spiral staircase, we couldn't bring our luggage downstairs, admittedly we had quite large suitcases.  We were made feel very welcome and Gina communicated with us regularly, offering advice for all aspects of our stay.  To be honest Gina felt like a friend, even though I've never actually met her.

What a lovely, cozy and comfortable condo/townhome!  It was perfect for two couples.  We visited for a couple of days in mid-October prior to getting on a fall foliage cruise.  The location was perfect for sightseeing -- less than a block to the North Church and the Freedom Trail -- and centrally located between the airport and cruise terminal, so taxi was only $15 each way for four adults and lots of luggage!  You enter on the main level which has a living room, half bath, and beautiful kitchen.  The very nicely appointed bedrooms are on the lower level and share a full bath.  To get to the bedrooms, you go down a narrow spiral staircase from the kitchen, so if you have mobility issues this may not be a good choice for you.  However, we had no problems (all of us in our 60's), and we thought the staircase was very quaint and unique.  Gina was a wonderful host and was always responsive to my numerous texts.  She provided lots of good tips on places to eat, things to do, and sights to see.  We would definitely stay at Gina's place in the future!

<br/>A couple of things to be aware of - the apartment is in a bit of a marginal neighborhood in East Boston.   We did not feel uncomfortable walking at night and our car was fine parked on the street for 3 days, but it was a little rough around the edges.  Nothing to worry about, but just good to know.  Also, the apartment does not have air conditioning.  Luckily, we didn't need it during our stay and Meghan provides a fan to help circulate the air.  Again, it's just something to keep in mind.

A great place in a nice part of town. Meg was really nice and caring. The place was quite big and very clean close to the station and the airport. Nice restaurants are waiting just around the corner.

Meghan's place is lovely and she was a wonderful host. We stayed for three days in August and the two of us found her studio  perfect for our needs. The serene and calm space was conveniently located by the airport.

Very convenient for us, as we went downtown every day. The hosts were very helpful and friendly, providing us with clear directions and reliable communication.

Our stay in a room at Piter's house was enjoyable.  We did not have a car, so the five-minute walk to the T was a bonus.  We did not see much of Piter, but the room was large and comfortable.

There was less street noise than I was expecting for staying in the city, but when other guests arrived late at night they were quite loud.

The place was just as described. It’s an OK place to stay for the price. However, we first had some issues getting the correct key so we had to contact the host for a different code. Later that night when we were out in the city, the host called and accused us of using the wrong room. It was extremely confusing and rude, and we had actually ended up in the correct room all along. From what I️ understand, this was all due to a miscommunication between the hosts.<br/>On our last day, I️ had asked for a checkout time of 2:30 and the hosts agreed to that. At 2:15, the host contacted me and asked when we were coming to get our things because the cleaner was there. Did not feel welcome at all, but if you can live with that, the location is decent.

This is a good, affordable option if you're looking for a place to stay that's in walking distance of the red line train station. Unfortunately, the entire house is comprised of rental units so if it is fully booked, you'll find that 5-8 people will have to share one bathroom. The room itself is up 3 flights of steep stairs, so be prepared! I would also recommend bringing an eye mask and ear plugs because the curtains/blinds don't work well to block out light and other people staying there can be very loud!

All was great. Great communication, easy to arrive. And clear instructions to get the keys and go to the appartment. Huge room, clean towels. All great

Piter & Stacy were great hosts.  Everything we needed was provided upon arrival.  We would love to stay at their place again in the future.

Cute room, nice and quiet neighbourhood, but the extra bed is not so comfortable unless you're 12 or under. Good for families, for sure!

The room was quite okay, it's big and comfy. The only problem is that there was too much sun coming into the bedroom in the mornings. The white Persian blinds are partly broken and my advice to the owners is to change them so that guests can sleep a bit longer in the mornings if they would like. The neighborhood is pretty and there are many restaurants and stores.

This is a great place. Very comfortable bed, clean, safe area and friendly host. the walls are a little thin between rooms so you can almost hear the conversations, but except from that i recommend it!

This was my first time using Air B&B and I had a great experience at Todd's place! The room was very clean and nice, and everything was ready for me when I arrived. Arrival and check-out were also very easy! This place is really convenient if you are visiting Harvard, especially the Business School.

I stayed at Todds place for five days. The room was nice and clean and exactly as described. Todd was nice enough to offer me to switch to this room as I initially booked a room that was further away from HBS where I was attending a workshop. All in all I had an excellent experience.

Private room in a pretty quiet neighborhood.  Comfortable stay.  Good proximity to bus, very close to Harvard Square.  Great value.  <br/><br/>Bathroom is shared with other guests but I almost never saw the other guests.  Place is very clean.  And you even get to use the laundry machine.  Very happy with our stay.

Todd's place is beautiful! Very quiet location, but so close to everything. I would have liked a waste basket in the room and maybe a small TV (as we hit the brewery and went back to the room earlier than expected), but that doesn't diminish the cleanliness and quietness of the place! We got there a bit earlier than check in time and Todd was very accommodating with letting us leave our rental while we explored until check in.<br/>Thanks, Todd! We would definitely recommend his place to other Boston-goers. :)

This room is an absolutely lovely, restful haven in a quiet neighborhood. I'm not exaggerating when I say it was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! Excellent location, quick walks or a short Lyft/Uber ride to anywhere I needed to go. The room and entire home was super clean, beautiful and well-kept. Easy check in and check out. I felt safe and relaxed the whole time I was there. Would absolutely rent from Todd again!

The room is just as expected, its very fresh and looks newly renovated. The bathroom is clean and so is the room. <br/>It is located near harvard and MIT so no problem of just walking, but if you want to get into downtown you would have to uber in.<br/><br/>I very much recommend to stay here when in Boston.

Very happy to have stayed at Todd's while I attending a conference downtown. Guests without a car should note that travelling into the centre requires a bus and metro trip and may take a while, but this place was fantastic value for me nevertheless. The bed is especially luxurious! I would absolutely stay there again next time I'm in town.

I loved staying at Todd’s place!! Great value! It was nice and quiet and cozy, with a very comfortable bed, sparkling clean room and bathroom. I slept great. The bathroom is shared with one other room, which was fine with me. The check in was very easy using the code. Todd was very quick to respond. It’s in a great part of town, very accessible to the city! I would definitely stay here again!

Linda was a very gracious host. She never stopped smiling and made us feel very welcomed. The listing description was very accurate. The location is fantastic. It is located within the Boston city limits and a short drive from the downtown. There are some amazing restaurants just a short walk away. This is our number one location if we ever come back to Boston.

Great space in a great location. Linda has thought of everything, and the little details really helped to make us feel at home. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and offers easy access to downtown and other parts of the Boston area. We were surprised and happy to find some excellent restaurants within a quick walk from the house.

I stayed here with 2 other friends of mine. The place was very clean and in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. We also liked having access to a full bathroom in our floor (2nd). There was always available parking off the street which was free and the host (Linda) was accommodating for offering one of her 2 spots behind the house. <br/><br/>However, we visited Boston at a time that was very cold in the low 50s Fahrenheit most days. The host was not very accommodating in regards to heating the home and/or the rooms we were staying at. Everywhere in the home was very cold including the linens if you touched them or once you laid on them. The host would set the heat to 65F or lower and when we turned the heat up on our floor, the host (who lives on 3rd floor) would come to our floor and turn it down. This happened twice during the first night. I woke up from being cold twice and saw the host on our floor. Instead of being empathetic when I told her that we were cold and I feel like getting sick, the host stated "this is too high. It’s ridiculous" which I found it rude. Each room had a heating vent which could be completely closed —the host could close her room’s vent if she wanted less heat. Or she could have provided us with a portable heater or something. Instead, she told me to just use more blankets.<br/><br/>I got very sick after the first night and the other 2 friends got sick too after by the end or out 4 nights stay there. The heat would still not keep the house warm since it was just one smaller central AC in a closer distributing heat to 3 floors and a basement. In addition, although the host had agreed to keep the heat “at 70F at maximum”, she would still lower it down every now and then to 65 or less.<br/><br/>My friends and I did not feel comfortable sleeping here. If the heating was taken care of, I would recommend this staying at this home.

Perfect place to stay while visiting Boston. A little out of the way, but easy to get to everywhere we wanted to go via MBTA. Linda is a great hostess. The rooms are cozy and the neighborhood is nice and we always felt safe. We had the two rooms upstairs so it was just our family sharing the bathroom. It was equipped with everything you would need just Incase you forgot anything. She provided coffee and cream and other breakfast items.

Linda is a very hospitable host. Her house is very clean, cozy, spacial, and it has everything you would need. Bedrooms are also very comfortable.
